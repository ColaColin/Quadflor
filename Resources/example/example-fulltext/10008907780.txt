Abstract: 
This paper summarizes in a non-technical way what we know from empirical studies 
based on firm-level data about the mutual links between international activities of 
firms and productivity. It is written with a view to inform policy makers in an evidence-
based way. A special focus is on the empirical evidence we have from studies using 
firm-level data from the Nordic countries. It is argued that this empirical evidence 
does not provide a sound basis to search for similarities and differences (and their 
causes) between the Nordic countries, and the empirical results reported cannot 
qualify as stylized facts that can inform policy makers in an evidence-based way.

1. Motivation 
Productivity – the efficiency with which firms turn inputs (labor, physical capital, 
energy, materials, managerial know-how) into outputs (goods, services) – is 
important for the competitiveness of firms, regions and countries on local, national 
and international markets. Productivity is an important driver of growth and welfare. 
Therefore, the study of productivity has been a core topic in economics for a long 
time. 
Empirical studies that use firm-level micro data to investigate the determinants 
and consequences of productivity differentials between firms, however, are of a more 
recent vintage. A case in point is the literature dealing with the links between 
productivity and international firm activities. This literature started with a Brookings 
paper by Bernard and Jensen (1995) that documents a positive exporter productivity 
premium in US manufacturing industries – exporters are more productive that non-
exporting firms of the same size from the same narrowly defined industry. This paper 
started a literature. During the past 15 years economists all over the world used firm-
level micro data to investigate productivity differences between exporting and non-
exporting firms and the direction of causality between export activity and firm-level 
productivity (see Wagner (2007) for a survey). More recently researchers interested 
in the links between international firm activities and productivity started to look 
beyond exports and to investigate other forms of international firm activities (imports, 
foreign direct investment, offshoring), to look beyond manufacturing and to 
investigate services, and to investigate the role of countries of origin and destination 
of imports and exports.1 
                                                            
1 Furthermore, other dimensions of firm performance besides productivity – like growth, profitability, 
and wages paid – were investigated, too. This literature, however, is beyond the scope of this paper 
 3 
 
This literature on the micro-econometrics of international firm activities inspired 
theorists to develop what is now labeled the new new trade theory where 
heterogeneous firms that differ in productivity are at the heart of the theoretical 
models.2  
All this resulted in a mushrooming literature.3 This paper summarizes in a non-
technical way what we know from this literature about the mutual links between 
international activities of firms and productivity with a view to inform policy makers in 
an evidence-based way. Given the focus on the Nordic countries of the conference 
this paper is prepared for Table 1 summarizes the empirical evidence we have from 
studies using firm-level data from the Nordic countries.4 These studies will be 
discussed in turn in the appropriate sections of the paper. 
                                                                                                                                                                                         
that has a focus on productivity. For international firm activities and growth see Wagner (2002), for 
profitability Fryges and Wagner (2010), and for wages Schank, Schnabel and Wagner (2007, 2010). 
2 The canonical model from this literature is Melitz (2003); Redding (2010) is a survey. 
3 For partial surveys see Lopéz (2005), Helpman (2006), Greenaway and Kneller (2007), Wagner 
(2007) and Hayakawa, Kimura and Machikita (2010). 
4 I am grateful for hints to papers on international firm activities and productivity that are based on firm 
level data from Nordic countries and that are not listed in Table 1. Given the topic of the conference 
this paper is prepared for the focus is on productivity and international firm activities. Other important 
dimensions of firm performance that are closely linked to international firm activities include survival, 
employment, profitability, innovation, and wages. Empirical studies using firm level data to investigate 
these links abound, and some of the papers covered in this survey at least touch upon other issues 
besides productivity. Studies for Nordic countries from this literature that do not discuss productivity 
but other dimensions of firm performance include the following: Survival (Bandick (2010) on foreign 
ownership and plant survival in Sweden; Bandick and Görg (2010) for foreign acquisition in Sweden; 
Greenaway, Gullstrand and Kneller (2008a, 2009) for international trade and foreign ownership with 
relation to firm exit in Sweden); employment (Bandick and Görg (2010) for foreign acquisition in 
Sweden; Deschryvere and Kotiranta (2008) for offshoring of Finnish firms; Ekholm and Hakkala (2008) 
for offshoring of Swedish firms; Eliasson, Hansson and Lindvert (2010) on jobs and exposure to 
international trade within the service sector in Sweden; Hummels et al. (2010) for outsourcing in 
Denmark; Huttunen (2007) for foreign acquisitions in Finnish establishments; Ibsen, Warzynski and 
Westergard-Nielsen (2009) on the relation between export and import decision and employment

 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section two looks at exports 
and imports. Section 3 deals with outward and inward foreign direct investment. 
Section 4 looks at offshoring of activities to foreign countries. Section 5 summarizes 
what we know and what we don’t know about the mutual links between international 
firm activities and productivity in Nordic countries and elsewhere and discusses 
policy implications. 
 
2. International trade and productivity 
2.1 Exports and productivity 
Discussions of the role of exports in promoting growth in general, and productivity in 
particular, have been going on for many years.5 Earlier empirical studies in this field 
                                                                                                                                                                                         
growth in Denmark; Lehto and Böckermann (2008) on the effects of cross-border mergers and 
acquisitions on employment in Finland; Lööf (2009) on trade and employment growth in firms from 
manufacturing and services in Sweden; Munch (2010) on international outsourcing and job loss in 
Denmark; Pesola (2009) on labor market transitions following foreign acquisitions in Finland); 
innovation (Andersson and Lööf (2009b) for trade and innovative activities in small and medium sized 
enterprises in Sweden; Dachs, Ebersberger and Lööf (2007) for foreign owned vs. domestic 
enterprises from Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden; Bandick, Görg and Karpaty (2010) for 
foreign acquisition and R&D activities in Sweden); Laursen (2008) for innovation and export 
performance in Danish manufacturing and services firms; wages (Bandick (2009) on foreign 
acquisition in Sweden; Fosse and Maitra (2010) for offshoring to China from Danish firms; Geishecker, 
Görg and Munch (2010) for offshoring by Danish firms; Heyman, Sjöholm and Gustavsson Tingvall 
(2007) on foreign ownership wage premium in Sweden; Hummels et al. (2010) for outsourcing in 
Denmark; Huttunen (2007) for foreign acquisitions in Finnish establishments; Lundin and Yun (2009) 
on international trade and wages in Sweden; Munch and Skaksenon exports and wages in Denmark; 
Pesola (2007) on foreign ownership in Finland).

used data at the country or industry level to test whether exports promote productivity 
growth or vice versa. In 1995 Bernard and Jensen published the first of series of 
papers that changed this research perspective (see Bernard and Jensen 1995). They 
used large comprehensive longitudinal data from surveys performed regularly by 
official statistics in the U. S. to look at differences between exporters and non-
exporters in various dimensions of firm performance, including productivity. These 
papers started a literature. During the years following the publication of Bernard and 
Jensen’s Brookings paper researchers all over the world discovered the rich data 
sets collected by their statistical offices as a source to investigate the export activity 
of firms, and its causes and consequences. The extent and cause of productivity 
differentials between exporters and their counterparts which sell on the domestic 
market only is one of the core topics in this literature. 
There are two alternative but not mutually exclusive hypotheses why exporters 
can be expected to be more productive than non-exporting firms (see Bernard and 
Jensen 1999; Bernard and Wagner 1997). The first hypothesis points to self-
selection of the more productive firms into export markets. The reason for this is that 
there exist additional costs of selling goods in foreign countries. The range of extra 
costs include transportation costs, distribution or marketing costs, personnel with skill 
to manage foreign networks, or production costs in modifying current domestic 
products for foreign consumption. These costs provide an entry barrier that less 
successful firms cannot overcome. Furthermore, the behaviour of firms might be 
forward-looking in the sense that the desire to export tomorrow leads a firm to 
improve performance today to be competitive on the foreign market, too. Cross-
section differences between exporters and non-exporters, therefore, may in part be 
 6 
 
explained by ex ante differences between firms: The more productive firms become 
exporters.  
The second hypothesis points to the role of learning-by-exporting. Knowledge 
flows from international buyers and competitors help to improve the post-entry 
performance of export starters. Furthermore, firms participating in international 
markets are exposed to more intense competition and must improve faster than firms 
who sell their products domestically only. Exporting makes firms more productive. 
A common approach to investigate differences in productivity between 
exporters and non-exporters is to follow (sometimes only in part, and sometimes with 
modifications and extensions) the methodology introduced by Bernard and Jensen 
(1995, 1999). Studies of this type use longitudinal data for plants (usually from the 
regular surveys conducted by official statistics) to document differences in levels and 
growth rates of productivity between exporters and non-exporters in a first step. Here 
one starts by looking at differences in average labour productivity (total value of 
shipments per worker, or value added per worker) or average total factor productivity 
between exporters and non-exporters. The result is an unconditional productivity 
differential. 
The next step is the computation of so-called exporter premia, defined as the 
ceteris paribus percentage difference of labour productivity between exporters and 
non-exporters. These premia are computed from a regression of log productivity on 
the current export status dummy and a set of control variables (usually including 
industry, region, firm size measured by the number of employees, and year). The 
export premium shows the average percentage difference between exporters and 
non-exporters. 
 7 
 
To shed light on the empirical validity of the first hypothesis mentioned – 
namely, that the more productive firms go abroad – the pre-entry differences in 
productivity between export starters and non-exporters are investigated next. If good 
firms become exporters then we should expect to find significant differences in 
performance measures between future export starters and future non-starters several 
years before some of them begin to export. To test the second hypothesis mentioned 
– namely, that exporting fosters productivity - the post-entry differences in 
productivity growth between export starters and non-exporters are investigated.  
Wagner (2007) gives a synopsis of findings from 54 empirical studies that use 
firm-level data from 34 countries and that investigate the relationship of exports and 
productivity. Among the countries covered are highly industrialised countries (e.g., 
U.S., UK, Canada, Germany); countries from Latin America (Chile, Colombia, 
Mexico); Asian countries (China, Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan); transition countries 
(Estonia, Slovenia); and least developed countries from sub-Saharan Africa. Given 
this wide range of countries the big picture is amazingly clear-cut: With only a few 
exceptions exporters are found to have higher productivity, and often higher 
productivity growth, and this tends to hold after controlling for observed plant 
characteristics (like industry and size), too. Exporters are better. 
The findings for pre-entry differences often present evidence in favour of the 
self-selection hypothesis: Future export starters tend to be more productive than 
future non-exporters years before they enter the export market, and often have 
higher ex-ante growth rates of productivity. The good firms go abroad. 
Evidence regarding the learning-by-exporting hypothesis is somewhat more 
mixed: Results for post-entry differences in performance between export starters and 
 8 
 
non-exporters point to faster productivity growth for the former group in some studies 
only. Exporting does not necessarily improve firms.6 
Does the big picture sketched here – exporters are more productive than non-
exporters, and the more productive firms self-select into export markets, while 
exporting does not necessarily improve productivity – describe the situation in the 
Nordic countries, too? From the empirical studies summarized in Table 1 we see that 
exporters tend to be more productive than firms that serve the national market only in 
all four countries. Some evidence for self-selection of more productive firms into 
exporting has been found for Denmark, Finland and Sweden (but not in every study 
testing for it), while this hypothesis is not tested in the studies using data for Norway. 
The learning-by-exporting hypothesis has only been investigated with Danish and 
Swedish firm level data – with mixed results. Apparently, in the case of the Nordic 
countries the jury is still out on the direction of causality between exporting and 
productivity. 
 
2.2 Imports and productivity 
While the causes and consequences of export and its mutual relationships with 
productivity are prominent topics in the recent literature on internationally active 
firms, imports are seldom dealt with. A case in point is the recently published Bruegel 
study on the internationalisation of European firms (Mayer and Ottaviano 2007) 
where imports are not dealt with at all. As Bernard et al. (2007: 123) recently put it, 
“(t)he empirical literature on firms in international trade has been concerned almost 
                                                            
6 Note, however, that De Loecker (2010) recently showed that current methods that are used to test 
for learning by exporting are biased towards rejecting the hypothesis of positive effects of exports on 
productivity. He provides evidence for this in the case of Slovenia. Comparable empirical results for 
other countries are to the best of my knowledge not available. 
 9 
 
exclusively with exporting, largely due to limitations in datasets … . As a result, the 
new theories of heterogeneous firms and trade were developed to explain facts about 
firm export behavior and yield few predictions (if any) for firm import behavior.”  
This situation, however, is changing rapidly.7 With new datasets that include 
information on imports at the firm level becoming available for more and more 
countries a new literature is emerging since 2005 that has a focus on the links 
between productivity and imports. A number of recently published empirical studies 
based on data from a wide range of countries document the shares of firms that are 
exporters, importers, and two-way traders (that both export and import), or that sell or 
buy on the national market only, and they look at differences between these four 
types of firms. Differences in productivity and their relationship with different degrees 
of involvement in international trade are at the centre of these studies. 
Details aside, the big picture that emerges from this literature can be sketched 
as follows: There is a positive link between importing and productivity at the firm 
level, documented by a significant productivity differential between firms that import 
and firms that do not trade internationally; the same holds for exporting.  Two-way 
traders are more productive than firms that either only import, or only export, or do 
not trade at all. Often, two-way traders are the most productive group of firms, 
followed by importers and then exporters, while firms selling or buying on the national 
market come last. 
How can this empirical regularity of a positive relationship between importing 
and productivity at the firm level be explained theoretically? In the literature 
arguments for both a positive impact of productivity on importing (which is in

see Vogel and Wagner (2009). 
 10 
 
accordance with self-selection of more productive firms into import markets) and for a 
positive impact of importing on productivity (‘learning-by-importing’) are discussed.  
To start with the arguments in favour of self-selection of more productive firms 
into importing it is pointed out that the use of foreign intermediates increases a firm’s 
productivity but, due to fixed costs of importing, only inherently highly productive 
firms import intermediates. Importing is associated with fixed costs that are sunk 
costs, because the import agreement is preceded by a search process for potential 
foreign suppliers, inspection of goods, negotiation, contract formulation etc. 
Furthermore, there are sunk costs of importing due to the learning and acquisition of 
customs procedures. 
As regards learning-by-importing it is stated that there are strong arguments in 
favour of a causal effect of imports on productivity, because by importing a firm can 
exploit global specialization and use inputs from the forefront of knowledge and 
technology. Proponents of this view point to the literature on international technology 
diffusion that advances imports as an important vehicle for knowledge and 
technology transfer. Furthermore, importing intermediate products allows a firm to 
focus resources and to specialize on activities where it has particular strengths. 
Importers may improve productivity by using higher quality foreign inputs or by 
extracting technology embodied in imported intermediates and capital goods. 
Furthermore a variety effect is mentioned (in which the broader range of available 
intermediates contributes to production efficiency) and a quality effect caused by 
imported intermediates that might be of better quality than local ones.  If importing 
increases productivity, this might lead firms to self-select into export markets and 
help to improve their success in these markets, which might contribute to an 
 11 
 
explanation of the empirical regularity that two-way traders are the most productive 
firms on average. 
From a theoretical point of view, therefore, the direction of causality between 
productivity and importing can run from one of the two sides or from both sides 
simultaneously. Only some of the studies mentioned above tackle this issue (or at 
least a part of it) empirically. The bottom line, then, is that we have convincing 
empirical evidence on a positive relationship between importing and productivity at 
the level of the firm for a large and growing number of developed and developing 
countries, while research on the direction of causality between productivity and 
import status is still in its infancy.  
Vogel and Wagner (2009) use a newly available comprehensive panel data 
set for manufacturing enterprises from 2001 to 2005 to document the first empirical 
results on the relationship between imports and productivity for Germany, a leading 
actor on the world market for goods. Furthermore, for the first time the direction of 
causality in this relationship is investigated systematically by testing for self-selection 
of more productive firms into importing, and for productivity-enhancing effects of 
imports (‘learning-by-importing’). They find a positive link between importing and 
productivity. From an empirical model with fixed enterprise effects that controls for 
firm size, industry, and unobservable firm heterogeneity they report that the premia 
for trading internationally are about the same in West and East Germany. Compared 
to firms that do not trade at all two-way traders do have the highest premium, 
followed by firms that only export, while firms that only import have the smallest 
estimated premium. They find evidence for a positive impact of productivity on 
importing, pointing to self-selection of more productive enterprises into imports, but 
 12 
 
no evidence for positive effects of importing on productivity due to learning-by-
importing.  
Empirical evidence on the links between imports and productivity based on 
econometric studies using firm-level data from the Nordic countries is scarce. From 
Table 1 we see that imports and productivity are positively associated in Denmark 
and Sweden. For Denmark, we have evidence for self-selection into importing of 
more productive firms but not for learning from importing. Furthermore, for Sweden 
we have evidence that imports lead to an increase in productivity, and that this effect 
is larger for imports from highly developed countries. This evidence, however, is 
based on only one study per country and topic. Studies with data from Finland and 
Norway are missing. The bottom line, therefore, is that we have no sound empirical 
evidence on the links between imports and productivity in the Nordic countries. 
 
3. Foreign direct investment and productivity 
3.1 Outward foreign direct investment 
Besides international trade (exports and imports) other forms of international 
activities of firms and their relation with productivity are investigated both theoretically 
and empirically. A case in point is the multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium 
model of Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple (2004) that explains the decision of 
heterogeneous firms to serve foreign markets either trough exports or through foreign 
direct investment, i.e. by building new production facilities in a foreign county or by 
acquiring existing firms there. They show that, in equilibrium, only the more 
productive firms choose to serve the foreign markets, and the most productive 
among this group will further choose to serve these markets via foreign direct 
investment. The intuition behind this theoretical result is similar to the argument put 
 13 
 
forward in the case of exports and productivity. There exist additional costs of starting 
production activities in a foreign country, including costs to become familiar with all 
legal and economic aspects related to doing business abroad, and these costs can 
be expected to be even larger than the extra costs a firm that exports has to pay 
compared to a firm that sells its products on the national market only. Only the most 
productive firms can be expected to be able to pay these costs and to produce 
profitably in a foreign country. 
Several empirical papers take the Helpman-Melitz-Yeaple model as a point of 
departure.8 Wagner (2006) uses German establishment level data and uses a non-
parametric test for first order stochastic dominance to show that, in line with this 
hypothesis, foreign direct investors are indeed more productive (not only at the mean 
but over the whole range of the productivity distribution) than exports, which in turn 
are more productive (again, not only at the mean but over the whole range of the 
productivity distribution) than firms that sell their products on the national market 
only. Empirical evidence for other countries (including Japan and the UK) points in 
the same direction (see Wagner (2006)).  
However, according to the summary of empirical studies on international firm 
activities and firm performance reported in Table 1 there is as yet no evidence on the 
link of outward foreign direct investment and productivity from the Nordic countries. 
 
3.2 Inward foreign direct investment 
Foreign direct investment cannot only take the form of domestic firms from country A 
buying a firm in a foreign country B or building a new production facility abroad in B 
                                                            
8 See Wagner (2006) for a more complete discussion of this literature. 
 
 14 
 
(i.e. outward foreign direct investment from the point of view of country A). Foreign 
firms from country B can buy a domestic firm in country A or build a new production 
facility in A. This latter type of foreign direct investment is called inward foreign direct 
investment (from the point of view of country A) and it leads to foreign owned firms in 
country A. 
Productivity differences between domestic and foreign owned firms have been 
investigated in a large number of empirical studies. From a theoretical point of view it 
can be expected that foreign owned firms are more productive than domestic firms 
because foreign owned firms can use technological knowledge and management 
know-how owned by their parent company that made the parent company highly 
successful and productive (which can be viewed as a prerequisite for the parent 
company to become a multinational firm with production facilities in a foreign 
country). Furthermore, it might be the case that foreign investors engage in “cherry 
picking” – they buy the best and most productive domestic firms. Productivity 
differentials should then show up between domestic and foreign owned firms of the 
same size and from the same industry. The big picture from empirical studies is in 
line with these hypotheses – foreign owned firms tend to be more productive than 
domestic firms.9 
The empirical evidence we have from studies based on firm level data from 
the Nordic countries (summarized in Table 1) is in line with the findings from the 
international literature. Dachs, Ebersberger and Lööf (2008) report that foreign 
owned enterprises exhibit a significantly higher labor productivity than do 
domestically owned enterprises in all four Nordic countries. Ilmakunnas and 
                                                            
9 For a survey of empirical studies on productivity differentials between foreign owned firms and 
domestic firms see Barba Navaretti and Venables (2004), p. 155 – 162. 
 15 
 
Maliranta (2004) find that foreign ownership increases the total factor productivity by 
between 9 and 11 percent in Finland. Balsvik and Haller (2010) show that in Norway 
prospective foreign owners pick high-productivity plants and that labor productivity 
increases after foreign acquisitions. A similar positive effect of acquisition of home 
firms by foreign firms on productivity is reported by Karpaty (2008) for Sweden; 
Bandick (2009), however, finds that targeted Swedish firms have better productivity 
growth after vertical foreign acquisition only and not after horizontal foreign 
acquisition. 
 
4. Offshoring 
The third type of international firm activity besides international trade (exports and 
imports) and (outward and inward) foreign direct investment that is looked at in this 
paper with a view on its relation to productivity is offshoring. Offshoring means 
different things to different people. Here offshoring describes the relocation of 
processes to any foreign country without distinguishing whether the provider is 
external or affiliated with the firm. It is a process whereby an activity which was 
previously undertaken in-house is contracted to another supplier in a foreign country.  
There is evidence that offshoring firms differ systematically from non-
offshoring firms.10 In a comprehensive survey of the literature Görg, Greenaway and 
Kneller (2008, p. 34) ask “whether, among a random sample of firms we would 
expect all to engage in offshoring or whether it is only a certain group of firms that do 
so”. According to the authors the “short answer to this is: only a certain group – and 
we would expect this to comprise the ‘better’ firms in any sample.” Görg, Greenaway 
                                                            
10 For a more complete summary of the literature on offshoring and productivity see Wagner (2011). 
 
 16 
 
and Kneller (2008, p. 35) summarize empirical evidence from a number of studies 
showing that offshoring firms are more productive. 
If firms that relocated parts of their activities abroad are more productive than 
non-offshoring firms at a point in time this might be caused by self-selection of 
“better” firms into offshoring. Self-selection would be in line with recent developments 
in economic theory of international firm activities. Offshoring involves substantial 
sunk costs related to searching for a foreign partner, doing market research, fixing 
contractual arrangements etc. Therefore, only the more productive firms will be able 
to overcome these sunk cost barriers and successfully start to offshore (see Antràs 
and Helpman (2004) and Görg, Greenaway and Kneller (2008, p. 34f.). Studies 
focusing on the consequences of offshoring for productivity are rare (see Olsen 
(2006), p. 9). Görg, Greenaway and Kneller (2008, p. 8) summarize the findings by 
stating that for manufacturing firms offshoring results in higher labour productivity.  
For West German firms from manufacturing industries Wagner (2011) finds 
that, compared to non-offshoring firms, offshoring firms are more productive. These 
differences existed in the year before some firms started to offshore, and this points 
to self-selection of more productive firms into offshoring. This finding is in line with 
results from recent theoretical models and with results for other countries. 
To investigate the effects of relocation across borders on productivity, the 
performance of firms with and without offshoring was compared for 2000 - 2004 
when some firms were relocating firms and the others were not. Looking at first-time 
offshorers in 2001 - 2003 he finds no evidence for a causal effect of offshoring on 
productivity. When the group of offshoring firms includes firms with offshoring 
activities before 2001, however, he reports a positive and statistically significant 
causal effect, but this effect is rather small.  
 17 
 
The bottom line, then, is that the empirical evidence points to higher 
productivity in offshoring firms compared to non-offshoring firms, and to self-selection 
of more productive firms into offshoring, while the jury is still out on the issue whether 
offshoring improves productivity in a firm or not. Note that due to the absence of 
empirical studies on offshoring and productivity that are based on firm-level data from 
the Nordic country we have no evidence at all on this issue for these countries. 
 
5. Discussion 
The big picture shown by the literature on the micro-econometrics of international 
firm activities for the links between productivity and engagement on foreign markets 
can be summarized as follows. Details aside, internationally active firms are more 
productive than firms of the same size and from the same industry that are active on 
the domestic market only. The direction of causality between productivity and 
international activities is somewhat less clear. Higher productivity seems to be a 
prerequisite for international activities, and we have ample evidence for self-selection 
of more productive firms into exporting, foreign direct investment and offshoring. 
Whether international activities cause higher productivity or not, however, is still an 
unresolved question, and there are empirical studies reporting evidence for or 
against the learning-by-international-activities hypothesis. 
Empirical evidence from firm-level data based studies for the Nordic countries 
on the links between international firm activities and productivity is scarce (see Table 
1). While there are studies on exports and productivity and on productivity differences 
between foreign owned firms and domestic firms for Denmark, Finland, Norway and 
Sweden, evidence for imports is only available for Denmark and Sweden, while there 
is no empirical evidence at all on the relationship between productivity and both 
 18 
 
outward foreign direct investment and offshoring. Furthermore, there is often only 
one study dealing with one form of international firm activity for a country. The 
empirical evidence available, therefore, is no sound basis that allows searching for 
similarities and differences (and their causes) between the Nordic countries, and the 
empirical results reported cannot qualify as stylized facts that can inform policy 
makers in an evidence-based way.11 A suggested step on the way to a solid 
empirical basis for such an exercise is an ex-ante coordinated international 
comparative study that uses identically specified empirical models and comparable 
firm-level data for all forms of international firm activities covering firms from all 
Nordic countries and for other countries that are thought to be useful as a 
benchmark.12 
An important topic that is not dealt with in this paper but that is closely related 
to the links between productivity and international activities of firms is the cause of 
productivity differences between firms. In the theoretical models a la Melitz (2003) 
that are at the core of the new new trade theory productivity of a firm is the result of a 
random draw from a productivity distribution. While this is for sure an appropriate 
approach to build a theoretical model for trade with heterogeneous firms, it is far from 
satisfactory from an empirical point of view. Obviously there is a role for random 
shocks, or good or bad luck, in shaping the productivity level of a firm, but we have 
good reasons to believe that a high or low level of productivity is not a matter of luck 
                                                            
11 This is yet another case that illustrates what I call Bartelsman’s Lament: “For policy makers, the 
state of affairs of productivity research is frustrating, at best.” (Bartelsman 2010, 1891). For a 
comprehensive discussion of how to go from estimation results to stylized facts when empirically 
investigating international activities of heterogeneous firms see Wagner (2010). 
12 See International Study Group on Exports and Productivity (ISGEP) (2008) for an example of such a 
study and Wagner (2010) for a broader discussion of this approach.

alone. Productivity can be expected to be related to the quality of inputs used in the 
production process, and to the way these production factors are combined.  
Using a knowledge production framework and a rich set of plant level data 
Wagner (2008) demonstrates that in Germany firms that are active on international 
markets as exporters or foreign direct investors do generate more new knowledge 
than firms which sell on the national market only. These differences are not only due 
to a larger firm size, or different industries, or the use of more researchers in these 
firms, but due to the fact these globally engaged firms learn more from external 
sources, too. The importance of these knowledge sources varies with the type of 
innovation – for example, cooperation in R&D with universities and other research 
institutes matters in the case of new patents registered, while suppliers are important 
in the case of the share of new products in total sales and new production processes 
introduced. These results, which are broadly in line with the findings by Criscuolo, 
Haskel and Slaughter (2005) in their study using UK firm level data, can help to 
explain the strong positive correlation between productivity and international activities 
of firms. Firms that are active on markets beyond the national borders generate 
higher levels of new knowledge that feed into higher productivity. 
Another important aspect that might help to explain the positive productivity 
premium of internationally active firms is management quality. Although management 
quality has been considered as an important source of performance differences 
between firms for a very long time – Syverson (2010, p. 14) mentions a study 
published in 1887 that made this point – empirical evidence on this is scarce due to 
data limitations. As Syverson (2010, p. 14) puts it, “(t)he identity, much less the 
characteristics, practices, or time allocation of individual managers are rarely known. 
Furthermore, managerial inputs can be very abstract. It’s not just time allocation that 
 20 
 
matters, but what the manager does with their time, like how they incentivize workers 
or deal with suppliers.” A recent study by Bloom and Van Reenen (2010) that 
relates management practices to productivity shows, among others, that firms that 
export (but do not produce) overseas are better-managed than domestic non-
exporters, but are worse-managed than multinationals. 
These findings demonstrate that there is more than sheer luck behind the 
observed productivity differences between firms. Before one speculates about 
implications of these results for the design of policy measures, however, one should 
remember that productivity differences at the firm level are notoriously difficult to 
explain empirically. “At the micro level, productivity remains very much a measure of 
our ignorance.” (Bartelsman and Doms 2000, p. 586) 
My suggested take-home message for policy makers and for their advisers 
from my reading of the literature on productivity and international firm activities, 
therefore, is simple if not trivial. Any policy measures that foster productivity are 
policy measures that help to make more firms more fit for the world market, and any 
policy measures that make domestic and foreign markets more open for 
internationally active firms help to improve productivity and to foster economic 
growth. Following the holy principle of comparative advantage, however, I leave any 
detailed suggestions for such policy measures to the specialists in that field.
