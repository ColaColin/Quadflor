East Asian Value Chains and the Global Financial 
Crisis

Executive summary 
 
Measuring the scale and impact of global value chains (GVCs) is extremely difficult. We 
know, for example, that a large part of the electronic components that China imports from 
is Asian neighbours are intermediate inputs that are simply assembled in China before 
being exported to Western consumers. But, we don’t have a good sense of what 
proportion of these imports end up in products destined for export and what proportion 
are consumed in China’s fast-growing domestic market. The large swings in Chinese 
trade during the global financial crisis offers us a unique opportunity to gain a better 
understanding of these relationships. 
 
During the global financial crisis, Chinese electronic exports to Canada and the U.S. fell 
off dramatically, declining by more than 50% between July 2008 and January 2009. 
Interestingly, Chinese electronics imports from its Asian neighbours fell off by just a 
little bit more at 60% and began to recover one month earlier. Furthermore, as the 
recovery began to take hold both the timing and scale of the rebound in Chinese exports 
of electronics to Canada and the U.S. and in Chinese imports of these products from its 
Asian neighbours were remarkably similar. This seems to support the belief that in this 
sector global value chains play an extremely important role with a large share of Chinese 
imports coming from the immediate region which are then assembled and sent on to 
markets in the West. A more rigorous evaluation of the data confirms that value chains 
play an extremely important role in the electronics sector in China with a high degree of 
Chinese imports in that sector directly tied to exports to other markets and with no lags, 
even in the monthly data. GVCs play a less important role in other, for example in 
Machinery a smaller portion of Chinese imports appear to be linked directly to exports 
and the lags are greater.

East Asian Value Chains and the Global Financial Crisis 
 
1. Introduction: 
 
When on September 15, 2008 Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, setting off a 
financial crisis that has been acclaimed as the most severe financial crisis since the 1929 
stock crash, Asian economies were not overly worried. Since the crisis originated from 
the financial system in the United States and parts of Europe, Asian nations thought 
themselves to a large degree sheltered from its effects. However, it soon became clear 
that they had been wrong. The financial crisis quickly translated into a serious global 
economic downturn and by the end of 2008, Asian economies had slowed down 
substantially with China recording 9% growth (down 4% from 2007) and Japan recording 
negative growth of -0.7% (compared to 2.3% in 2007). The outlook for 2009 is even 
darker, with GDP growth predictions of 6.5% and -6.8% for China and Japan, 
respectively, and similar forecasts for the rest of Asia (Global Outlook 2009). 
In a speech at the 40th Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting on February 14, 2009, 
Takatoshi Kato, IMF Deputy Managing Director, laid out the channels of transmission of 
the crisis to Asia. His first point concerned the myth of Asian independence from 
business cycles of advanced economies. Whereas some have interpreted the growth of 
intra-Asian trade as a sign of a shift from Asian export dependence on industrialized 
countries to Asian regional interdependence, the opposite is true. Asian economies have 
in fact grown even more dependent on exports to the U.S. and other developed countries 
and have hence become more exposed to shocks in these economies. The explanation as 
suggested by Mr. Kato and other experts is that intra-Asian trade is largely in parts and 
intermediate inputs or, in other words, that it is the reflection of growing global value 
chain production whose final products are still destined for export to the industrialized 
world (Kato 2009). 
The question that arises is how large intra-Asian trade in intermediate products actually is 
and to what degree Asian economies remain dependent on those of the developed world. 
In 2008, the IMF Asia and Pacific department estimated that the share of intermediate 
goods in trade flows in emerging Asia is around 65 percent, much higher than the 
corresponding figure for developed economies, which lies at about 40 percent. A study 
by Rumbaugh and Blancher specifically focused on China, who has been recognized as 
playing the central role of main importer of intermediate goods and exporter of final 
goods to the developed world, and estimated the share of China’s imports that are for 
processing and re-exporting at 50 percent (2004). 
What we hope to do in this paper is to contribute to the debate surrounding global value 
chain production by making use of the natural experiment provided by the current global 
economic crisis. If it is true that a large share of Asian intra-regional trade is in parts and 
intermediate inputs for final goods eventually exported to the industrial world and that 
Asian economies are consequently highly vulnerable to business cycle shocks in the 
developed economies, then we expect the financial crisis to have a significant negative 
impact on exports from the region to developed economies and a corresponding 
significant negative impact on intra-regional trade. Furthermore, if it is true that China 
plays the central role of assembly hub for intra-Asian products and final exporter to the

rest of the world, we assume that any trends will appear strongly in Chinese trade 
patterns. 
In order to test this hypothesis, we will make use of Trade Atlas data of Chinese exports 
and imports, which are recorded on a monthly basis and range from January 1995 to June 
2009. After a thorough examination of the trends in Chinese trade flows since 1995 with 
a focus on the months of the financial crisis, we will employ a slightly modified version 
of the standard gravity model of trade to measure the strength of the dependence of 
China’s imports from other East Asian nations on China’s exports to the final goods 
markets of North America and Europe. But first, we will briefly provide some 
background to the debate surrounding global value chain production. 
2. Background: 
In 2008, the IMF reported that intra-regional trade accounted for over 50 percent of total 
trade in Asia and that trade in intermediate goods within Asia is much higher than in 
other parts of the world. The share of intermediate goods in manufactured good flows in 
emerging Asia, for example, was estimated at about 65 percent, 8 percent higher than in 
1992 and 25 percent higher than the equivalent figure of 40 percent for similar trade 
among more developed economies. China plays a key role in these statistics, importing 
substantially from other East-Asian nations and exporting large amounts of goods to the 
rest of the world. 
Experts are in agreement that the reason behind this phenomenon is increasing 
specialization in vertical production stages, also termed global value chain production. 
The general story line is that China imports parts and intermediate goods from throughout 
the East-Asian region, assembles them into final products and exports these to the U.S. 
and other markets outside the region.  
Furthermore, while intra-regional trade in Europe has been observed to be mostly in final 
goods and is widely attributed to preferences for product variety, intra-Asian trade is 
largely in intermediate inputs and is thought to stem more from the exploitation of 
comparative advantages and economies of scale made possible by falling transport and 
communication costs (IMF 2008). 
The concept of comparative advantage, which dates back to David Ricardo in the early 
19th century, forms the backbone of classic trade theory. Whereas it was originally 
developed with respect to trade in final products, the theory is no less relevant for the 
production of intermediate goods. As Hekscher and Ohlin showed, differences in 
comparative advantages arise largely from differences in factor endowments. From this 
result, it can be deduced that if the production of a certain final product requires the input 
of a number of different factors of production that are concentrated across different 
countries, then it can be profitable for the countries to split up the production process 
according to this distribution of production factors; in other words, it is profitable for 
these countries to trade in factors of production. In the electronics industry, for example, 
China seems to be importing parts and components from higher-wage countries like 
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea and assembling them into final products which it then 
exports to overseas markets like the U.S. This phenomenon is much in line with the 
theory of comparative advantage, because China is well-endowed with cheap labour and 
therefore has a comparative advantage in assembly, whereas Japan, Taiwan and South 
Office of the Chief Economist: Analytical Report

Korea have better access to capital and advanced technology and so have the comparative 
advantage in producing the electronic parts that China then assembles into final products 
(Zebregs 2004). 
The theory of economies of scale is another influential theory used to explain 
developments in intra-Asian trade. The concept proposes that as the production of a good 
increases, average production costs fall, which can be due to high initial start-up costs or 
simply efficiency gains over time as best practices are identified. This provides another 
rationale for vertical specialization, since total production costs of a certain good across a 
number of countries can be reduced if each country focuses only on a limited number of 
production steps, accomplishing economies of scale in that production step and thereby 
decreasing average production costs (Aminian et al. 2008).  
Of course, both these theories assume that trade costs (such as transport and 
communication costs as well as tariffs) are zero. The moment this assumption is relaxed, 
it is no longer certain that benefits are to be had from specialization as the gain in reduced 
production costs might be outweighed by the additional trade costs.    
Since the 1980s, there has been a growing literature surrounding what may be called 
“New Trade Theory” and “New Economic Geography”, terms often traced to Paul 
Krugman. In his 1991 paper, Krugman points out that geography is underestimated as a 
determining factor of trade and develops a trade model that shows transportation costs 
(which depend directly on geography) to be a determinant factor in the localization of 
industries. He concludes that high transportation costs lead to a geographic concentration 
of firms within a given industry. The implication is that lowering transportation costs will 
in turn lead to a dispersion of firms. In line with this theory, the growth of intra-Asian 
trade in recent years can be seen as a dispersion of firms within the same industry across 
national borders as a result of falling transport costs. 
Since Krugman, other papers have focused more specifically on the driving forces behind 
offshoring and product fragmentation. Among the more recent and influential papers is 
Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008) where a fall in transportation and communication 
costs is recognized to have the same effect as a productivity increase of offshore 
production, in other words, increases the comparative advantage held by offshore 
production. Meanwhile, Hummels et al. formally illustrate that even a small reduction in 
trade barriers (i.e. falling transport costs and tariffs) can provide strong incentives for 
vertical specialization, since trade costs are incurred numerous times as an unfinished 
good crosses multiple borders before finalization. This result also offers an explanation 
for the disproportionate rise in recent years in trade in intermediate goods when 
compared to the rise in overall trade and GDP. According to Hummels et al., as trade 
barriers fall, trade in final goods will increase, but vertical specialization across national 
borders and consequently vertical trade will increase by even more (2001).  
 
In short, the global value chain trend in East Asia can largely be explained by differences 
in comparative advantages among the economies involved in the different steps of the 
production process (differences in endowments of labour, capital, and technological 
know-how), by the force of economies of scale, and by the recent rapid fall in trade 
barriers, mainly transport and communication costs but also tariffs.

Now, to what extent are global value chains actually established in China? What does the 
data say? 
 
3. Data Description: 
1. Trade volumes, GDP, and global supply chains 
Between 1995 and 2008 China’s export volume increased by 860% and imports by 
757%. Meanwhile, nominal GDP grew by approximately 494%. This means that over 
this period, the ratio of Chinese trade to GDP increased from 38.6% to 59.2% (64.3% in 
2007), which in turn has two main implications. Firstly, the excess of export growth over 
GDP growth suggests that a significant part of goods exported by China are not fully 
produced within the country. Therefore, China must be importing intermediate goods and 
thereby be partaking in global value chain production. Secondly, the higher trade to GDP 
ratio makes the Chinese economy as well as its partners in value chain production more 
vulnerable to fluctuations in foreign markets now than they were 14 years ago. 
2. China’s partners in global value chain production 
In line with the theory that China is increasingly involved in the assembly of parts and 
inputs sourced from other Asian countries into final products for destination markets 
overseas, a substantial and rising proportion of Chinese exports goes to North America 
and Europe, largely the U.S., Germany and the Netherlands, while over half of its imports 
come from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and other Asian countries.

In 1995, China’s top 3 export destinations were Hong Kong, Japan, and the U.S.; by 
2008, the U.S. had moved into first position and both the Netherlands and the United 
Kingdom had moved up the ranks, occupying the positions of 6th and 7th largest 
destinations for Chinese exports, respectively.

Exports to the developed countries outside Asia1 accounted for 31% of Chinese total 
exports in 1995; this figure had risen to 37% by 2008 with exports to the U.S. alone 
accounting for about 18%. Over the same period, the share of total exports going to Hong 
Kong fell from 24.2% to 13.4%. Considering that Hong Kong acts as a conduit for many 
Chinese exports to elsewhere, the proportion of total exports going to industrialized 
countries overseas obtained in this data is likely underestimated, though less  and less 
over time. Meanwhile, the share of exports going to other Asian countries2 decreased 
from 32.3% to 24%.

Imports:
China’s top 3 import sources in 1995 were Japan, the U.S., and Taiwan. By 2008, the 
U.S. had slipped into fifth position and was replaced by South Korea as second largest 
importer to China.

Imports from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, China, Malaysia, India, Singapore, Thailand, 
the Philippines and Indonesia made up 50.1% of total imports in 1995. This percentage 
had risen to 56.9% by 2007 before dropping to 52.2% in 2008. Over the same period, the 
share of imports from developed countries outside the region dropped from 33.3% to 
21.1%.

In general, exports to the overseas developed world have grown faster than imports from 
it, whereas China’s imports from other Asian countries have grown faster than its exports 
to them. This supports the notion of China’s increasingly important role as assembly hub 
and final exporter in Asian value chain production and reiterates the fact that China’s 
export-based economy and in turn the economies of its Asian import suppliers have 
become more vulnerable to foreign markets outside the region. 
 
3. Which sectors are most affected? 
China is well-recognized as a mass exporter of manufactured goods. These manufactured 
goods used to be principally from the textile industry. Over recent years, however, we 
have seen China shift from exports of textiles to exports of electronics and machinery 
(see Fig. 4). Between 1995 and 2008, the share of textiles in Chinese total exports fell by 
half, from 29.7% to 14.9%. Over the same time period, electronics’ share in exports 
nearly doubled from 12.8% to 24.0% and machinery exports more than tripled their 
share, rising from 5.8% to 18.8%. When combined, these two industries made up 42.8% 
of China’s total exports by 2008. However, while the share of electronics in China’s 
imports has also increased from 14.7% in 1995 to 23.6% in 2008 (26.9% in 2007), 
machinery’s share has dropped from 18.5% to 9.7%.

Looking specifically at imports from within Asia shows that between 1995 and 2008, the 
share of China’s electronics imports coming from other Asian countries4 has risen from 
52.1% to 57.4% (59.5% in 2007) while the corresponding share of machinery imports5
has dropped slightly from 45.7% to 42.6%. 
Over the same period, the share of China's exports going to the U.S., Canada, and Hong 
Kong6 have decreased in both electronics and machinery, although the drop in electronics 
seems to be mostly due to a decrease in exports to Honk Kong.

4. When the financial crisis hit: 
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, the IMF has forecasted world-wide 
economic growth in 2009 to come in at -1.1%, but has predicted trade volumes to drop by 
11.9%, so by a factor more than ten times higher than overall economic contraction (IMF 
2009). In fact, WTO statistics record nominal drops in world exports (imports) of 
merchandise of 33.1% (32.8%) for the second quarter of 2009 compared to the same 
period in 2008, preceded by drops of 31.3% (30.0%) and 10.8% (8.7%) in the first 
quarter of 2009 and last quarter of 2008, respectively, compared to a year earlier (WTO 
2009). These constitute the largest drop in trade since the Great Depression. 
There are a number of factors that may explain this, but global supply chains seem to lie 
at the very centre of it. In a paper recently published by the OECD Economics 
Office of the Chief Economist: Analytical Report 
 
12 
 
Department, the authors find that most of the drop in trade following the crisis can be 
explained by the contraction of global demand, magnified by a high income elasticity of 
trade. The authors present evidence that suggests that the world’s long-term income 
elasticity of trade has doubled since the late 1980s and suspect this to be largely the result 
of increasing international fragmentation of production (Cheung and Guichard 2009). 
When a good-in-process has to cross multiple national borders before finalization, a 
decrease in exports of the final good results in multiple decreases in trade transactions, 
making the change in trade flows a multiple of the change in export demand. The key 
problem here is that trade is measured in gross value, whereas GDP is measured in terms 
of value-added (Yi 2009). 
 Other factors that seem to have magnified the response of world trade to the economic 
recession include tightened trade credit conditions and protectionist reactions by trading 
nations. Furthermore, Cheung and Guichard suspect that a possible break-down or 
freezing of global supply chains during the crisis could account for another 10-20% of the 
observed drop in world trade. 
If it is true that global supply chains played an important factor in determining trade 
flows during the financial crisis, we expect regions and industries significantly involved 
in this type of production to be especially affected. Specifically, we expect China’s trade 
in electronics and machinery to have been heavily impacted by the crisis. Furthermore, 
we expect China’s imports in these industries from its suspected major input goods 
suppliers in Asia to drop relatively in tandem with China’s exports to its major final 
destination markets in North America and Europe. 
Our data does indeed show a fairly proportional and synchronised response of Chinese 
exports and imports to the financial crisis (see Fig. 8). China’s total exports fell by 52.4% 
between September 2008 and February 2009, while imports dropped 51.8% by January 
2009 and began to recover again in February, a month earlier than exports. This one-
month lag in recovery of exports behind imports is found in both the electronic 
machinery and the machinery sectors. Furthermore, in the machinery sector, exports also 
lagged imports by a month at the beginning of the crisis, still rising slightly between 
September and October 2008, while imports were already dropping. This could be a 
reflection of greater inventories or simply weaker value chain links in the machinery 
sector. Furthermore, imports dropped by more than exports in both sectors, although 
more prominently in electronic machinery where imports decreased 55.7% compared to a 
decrease in exports of 51.0%.

Compared to a year previous, both Chinese quarterly exports and imports during the 
crisis were down significantly. Compared to global trade flows, however, Chinese 
exports were less dramatically affected than exports for the rest of the world, while 
Chinese imports were more affected at first but recovered more quickly than the rest of 
the world.  
For China, quarterly exports in the electronic machinery were more negatively affected 
than average total exports while imports in the same sector were slightly less affected. 
Additionally, both exports and imports of electronic machinery dropped faster in 
response to the crisis than total Chinese trade flows and began to recover sooner. 
However, China’s trade in machinery was less impacted by the financial crisis than 
average Chinese trade.

Sectoral trade responses vis-à-vis major export markets and import sources:
Chinese exports to the U.S., Canada, and Honk Kong were much more strongly affected 
in electrical machinery than in machinery as were imports from major Asian source 
countries. However, in both sectors, imports from the examined Asian countries showed 
a modestly larger response than exports to North America and Hong Kong.

In the electrical machinery sector, exports to the U.S., Canada and HK and imports from 
Asia moved in almost perfect synchronization throughout the financial crisis, except for 
the one-month lag of export recovery in January 2009 (see Fig. 10). In the machinery 
sector, they were also relatively synchronized although not quite as closely as in the 
electronics sector (see Fig. 11). Interestingly, both machinery imports and exports began 
a downwards trend in July 2009 before the crisis officially started and experienced a 
small and temporary increase between November and December 2008.

4.Analysis of Trends: 
 
Between 1995 and 2008, China’s trade flows have increased at about twice the rate of 
GDP, supporting the belief that a significant share of Chinese trade is in intermediate 
goods. Over this period, China has shifted towards exporting more to industrialized 
countries outside Asia and importing more from other Asian countries. The U.S. has 
become China’s main export destination while Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have 
become its top 3 import sources. This gives further credence to China’s role as the 
assembly hub for Asia, importing parts and intermediate goods from other Asian 
countries and assembling them for final export to the U.S. and other overseas markets. It 
also means that China and its suppliers are more vulnerable to business cycles abroad 
than they used to be. Furthermore, China has seen a great shift away from textile 
manufacturing and towards trade in electronics and machinery, raising the question of the 
prevalence of global value chains in those sectors specifically. However, while imports of 
electronic machinery from China’s main source countries in Asia have risen somewhat 
faster than total imports, the opposite is true for machinery imports, suggesting that 
global value chains might be more prevalent in electronics than in machinery. 
The financial crisis set off in September 2008 has provided a rare opportunity to measure 
China’s involvement in global value chains against real world data. If China is truly 
integrated into global supply chains in the manner it is thought, we would expect the 
financial crisis that originated in the U.S., China’s biggest export destination, to have 
affected not only Chinese exports to the U.S. and other countries caught in the crisis, but 
by transmission, also Chinese imports from within Asia. Furthermore, we would expect 
the impact in the machinery and electronics sectors to be equally as strong as if not 
stronger than the impact on total Chinese trade volumes. 
The data shows that China’s trade has indeed been very negatively impacted by the 
financial crisis. In fact, exports to the U.S., Canada, and Honk Kong and even more so

imports from major Asian suppliers show stronger responses to the crisis than overall 
trade flows. Exports of electrical machinery dropped over 50% and imports close to 60%, 
while machinery exports fell 38% and imports 46%. The drops in exports and imports in 
both sectors occurred generally in tandem, with the exception of a one month lag in 
exports in January, when imports began to recover as exports continued to fall. These 
trends provide support once more the claim that global value chain production is an 
integral part to Chinese trade operations and that, while it is present in both the electrical 
machinery and the machinery sector, it is much more established in electrical machinery. 
 
Regression Analysis: 
We have until this point established that the trends in Chinese trade data over the past 15 
years and throughout the recent financial crisis support the East Asian value chain 
phenomenon. To formalize these results, we will now use basic econometric techniques 
to determine the degree of interdependence between China’s imports from within Asia 
and China’s exports to overseas markets, mainly the United States.  
Set-up:
We begin with the standard gravity model of trade and specify our null hypothesis as 
follows: Assuming that China is not involved in global value chain production, its 
imports from other Asian countries (here represented by Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, 
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines as these constitute China’s 
main import sources in Asia8) should not depend on overseas markets, namely North 
America and Europe, more so than they depend on regional economies’ strengths. 
The classic gravity model of trade predicts trade flows between two countries to be 
proportional to their combined economic weights (which can be measured in GDP) and 
the distance between them. The model is specified as follows: 
TradeAB = c(GDPA x GDPB)/DAB 
where c is a constant and DAB is the distance between countries A and B.  
According to this model, China’s imports from within Asia should depend on Chinese 
GDP, its supplier countries’ GDPs and the distance between them. The model does not 
allow for the influence of a secondary demand such as we are arguing is provided by the 
U.S. and other developed nations outside Asia other than indirectly channelled through 
Chinese GDP. The model should therefore look as follows: 
MChina-Asia = c(GDPChina x GDPAsia)/DChina-Asia  
(Equation 1) 
As an alternative hypothesis, we propose the following: If it is true that a substantial 
proportion of Chinese imports from other Asian countries consists of intermediate goods 
that are then finalized for export to the U.S. and other overseas destinations, then output 
shocks of these external economies could directly influence Chinese intra-regional 
imports as well. We use the United States as proxy for the developed countries overseas 
that constitute China’s main export market for value chain produced goods, since it is 
China’s largest export market and was most directly affected by the crisis. We have the 
following:

source 
Office of the Chief Economist: Analytical Report 
 
18 
 
MChina-Asia = c(GDPChina x GDPAsia x GDPUS)/DChina-Asia-US   
 (Equation 2) 
The question that poses itself is the following: Which equation predicts Chinese-Asian 
trade flows better and what can consequently be said about the influence of US GDP on 
Chinese imports from within Asia? 
We run three different regressions to determine the answers to these questions. For our 
first regression, we take standard logs of Equation 1 and 2 and model Chinese imports 
from Asia as a function of Chinese, Asian, and US GDP individually as well as 
combined. For simplicity purposes, distances are removed in this analysis, which proves 
to cause no particular harm9. Having seen in the data description section that there are 
few lags in the trends, we do not have to worry about time lags here and can simply set 
up our model as follow: 
LN(MChina-Asia i) = O0 + O1LN (GDPChina i) + O2LN(GDPAsia i) + ui
(Equation 3) 
LN(MChina-Asia i) = O0 + O1LN (GDPChina i) + O2LN(GDPAsia i) + O3LN(GDPUS i) + ui
(Equation 4) 
For an extension, we add Canadian and EU GDP to American GDP to give a better 
representation of “western” demand. However, we have to remember that many 
European countries were themselves only indirectly affected by the banking crisis, which 
could actually lead to significant lags and skew the regression. Furthermore, since EU 
GDP data is only available starting in 2000, the data set for this regression is more 
limited. 
Recognizing that GDP and trade values are relatively large and that a strong correlation 
between GDP and import levels could be indicative more of long-term causal effects 
rather than co-movement in short-term fluctuations, we also model changes in Chinese-
Asian imports as a function of changes in Chinese, Asian, and US GDP. For our second 
regression, we therefore take the first differences over time of Equation 1 and again test 
for separate as well as combined effects.  
P(MChina-Asia i) = O0 + O1P(GDPChina i) + O2P(GDPAsia i) + O3P(GDPUS i) + ui
(Equation 5) 
The two first regressions use quarterly data from 1995 until 2008 due to restrictions in 
GDP data. However, to fully capture the effects of the financial crisis and to examine the 
more direct relationship between China’s exports to the developed world outside Asia 
and its imports from within Asia, we also run a simplified model using only import and 
export data, which is recorded monthly from January 1995 to June 2009. The model is as 
follow: 
LN(MChina-Asia i) = O0 + O1LN(XChina-US i) + ui
(Equation 6) 
9 We have already seen that transportation and communication costs have become less and less significant 
over time. Furthermore, if anything, including the distance factor would add to the relative explanatory 
power of US GDP in the regression, since out of the countries included in the analysis, the US is the 
furthest away from China. 
Office of the Chief Economist: Analytical Report 
 
19 
 
and 
P(MChina-Asia i) = O0 + O1P(XChina-US i) + ui
(Equation 7) 
Lastly, starting from the fact that machinery and electronic machinery have become 
China’s primary manufacturing export industries and that lags within these sectors are 
minimal, we run regressions 3, 5 and 6 separately for electronics and for machinery in 
order to determine the relative strengths of the influence of secondary demand in these 
sectors.  
 
Estimation Results:
We find that Equation 4 does indeed have higher explanatory power than Equation 3 (see 
Tables 6-8) though the difference is not enormous. Trends in Chinese, Asian, and US 
GDP together account for 96.23% of trends in Chinese imports from within Asia, 
whereas Chinese and Asian GDP alone account for 92.58%. Furthermore, US GDP alone 
has higher explanatory power for Chinese-Asian trade than Chinese and Asian GDP 
combined, accounting for 94.37% of fluctuations in China’s imports from its Asian 
neighbours.  
It should be noted that the various GDP values used for the explanatory variables are 
inter-dependent and that this model hence exhibits multi-collinearity. Therefore, the 
individual coefficient values of O1-3 are not necessarily truly reflective of the explanatory 
power of each individual variable. However, after running the model using only US GDP 
as well as US and Chinese GDP and US and Asian GDP combined, we can conclude that 
a one percent change in US GDP induces a change of approximately 3% in Chinese-
Asian imports.  
As expected, adding EU and Canadian GDP to that of the US also adds to the explanatory 
power of the model and yields an R2 term of 98.51%. Furthermore, in the electronics 
sector, the influence of US GDP on Chinese Asian imports is slightly more pronounced 
than for all sectors combined, whereas in machinery it is slightly less pronounced.  
Equation 6 yields an R2 value of 97.44% and a value of 0.9741 for O1, suggesting that 
Chinese intraregional imports are indeed very dependent on exports to the US with an 
elasticity of almost 1. The results are close to identical in the electronics sector, while 
both R2 and O1 are lower for trade in machinery, falling to 90.21% and 0.7512, 
respectively. 
Finally, as expected, the R2 values for Equations 5 and 7 are much lower than those for 
the other models that deal with level variables. This can be attributed to short-term 
volatility in both changes in Chinese exports to the US and changes in Chinese imports 
from Asia, which could result from a number of circumstances such as price or inventory 
fluctuations. However, the R2 value still falls at 44.35% for Equation 7 and at 39.63% for 
Equation 5. In fact, whereas changes in Chinese GDP and changes in Asian source 
country GDP do not prove statistically significant in determining shifts in intra-regional 
imports, changes in US GDP and changes in Chinese exports to the US do yield 
significant t-values. We obtain coefficients of approximately 0.07 and 1.76, respectively. 
The last figure in particular is extremely high, indicating that a decrease in Chinese 
exports to the U.S. translates into an even larger decrease in China’s imports from other 
Office of the Chief Economist: Analytical Report 
 
20 
 
Asian countries, which is exactly what happened following the financial crisis and which 
is very much in line with the theory of East Asian value chains. Again, the coefficient and 
R2 values are even higher in the electronics sector and lower in the machinery sector.

Conclusion: 
It can be concluded that trends in Chinese trade since 1995 and especially the Chinese 
trade response to the financial crisis support the significant existence of global value 
chains in Chinese production networks. These networks seem to have expanded since 
1995 and appear to be very prevalent in the electrical machinery sector and less prevalent 
in the machinery sector.  Furthermore, China appears to be importing the majority of 
parts and intermediate goods from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, three of the most 
industrialized nations in Asia and exports a growing amount to the U.S., Canada, 
Germany, the Netherlands and other developed countries overseas.   
Regression analysis has shown that Chinese imports from within Asia are even more 
dependent on economic developments in the United States than on the strength of 
China’s own economy or the economies of its suppliers. Furthermore, the finding that the 
coefficient for Equation 6 is greater than one is perhaps the most important result of our 
regression analysis, since it suggests that for every product China exports to the U.S., it 
imports several intermediate inputs from other countries in the East Asia region. Whereas 
this result continues to hold in the electronics sector, it does not hold in the machinery 
sector and while we still have reason to believe that value chain production is present in 
the machinery sector, it becomes clear from this paper that it is primarily the electronic 
machinery sector that is to a large degree integrated into vertical supply networks. 
Clearly, the econometric model used in this paper is a simple one and while it still yields 
interesting results, there is room for expansion. One could for example include dummy

variables to control for differences in distances, tariffs and other trade barriers between 
the countries examined. Furthermore, the model suggested in this paper to measure the 
influence of secondary demand on bilateral trade flows could be built into a multi-lateral 
gravity model of trade that would be more reflective of the global supply chains that 
underlie so many of today’s trade interactions.    
For now, however, we can conclude that China does indeed act as the assembly hub and 
final export base for East Asian production networks, especially in electronics, and that, 
as the 2008 financial crisis has shown, China and its supply partners remain vulnerable to 
output shocks in the U.S. and other developed countries overseas.
