ABSTRACT 
 
Wages and Immigrant Occupational Composition in Sweden* 
 
This paper examines the relationship between immigrant occupational composition and 
wages in Sweden. Effects of changes in proportion of immigrant workers in different 
occupations on the wage levels of both natives and immigrants are estimated. Our results 
suggest that increases in immigrant density have only small effects on wages and that the 
negative relationship between wages and the proportion of immigrant workers in an 
occupation, observed in data, is almost entirely accounted for by measured and unmeasured 
worker skills. These results suggest that wage differences across occupations with different 
densities of immigrants are mainly due to quality sorting and to a lesser extent due to the 
existence of discrimination.

1. Introduction 
There is growing recognition that migration is one of the defining global issues of 
our time and an essential component of the economic life of every State. Today, 214 
million people, or 3.1 percent of the world?s population, live outside their country of 
birth.1 Rapid population growth combined with lack of economic opportunities induce 
people from developing countries to move elsewhere, and a declining and ageing 
population pressures developed countries to accept a high number of migrants, paving the 
way for an even greater mobility of people in years to come. 
The existing migration literature primarily focuses on the assimilation of the 
migrant workers in the host country labour market, mainly through their earnings and 
wage growth (Chiswick, 1978, 1980; Borjas, 1985, 1989; Baker and Benjamin, 1994; 
Bloom, Grenier, and Gunderson, 1995; Edin et al., 2000; Ekberg, 1990, 1994). The type 
of jobs that the migrant workers obtain, however, is a crucial issue that influences their 
performance in the destination country. Indeed, it is often argued that immigrant and 
native workers do not have equal access to ?good? jobs. This form of discrimination 
against immigrants has also been well documented (Piore, 1979; Hammar, 1985; 
Zimmermann, 1994; Green, 1995). One consequence of this form of discrimination is the 
different sectoral distribution of native and immigrant workers. 
In the face of changing landscape of the labour market in host countries, the 
negative relationship between wages and the immigrant composition of jobs, however, 
has received little attention. Using a unique longitudinal data set, this paper studies the

negative relationship between wages and the immigrant composition of occupations in 
Sweden, by contrasting the wages of workers in jobs with different immigrant density. 
The framework we adopt in this paper is similar to that used in Hirsch and 
Schumacher (1992) and Hirsch and Macpherson (2004). Focusing on racial composition 
and wages in the United States, Hirsch and Schumacher (1992) found that wages for 
white and black workers were considerably lower in industry-occupation-region groups 
with a high share of black workers due to quality sorting. This analysis was extended by 
Hirsch and Macpherson (2004) using racial density as an index of unobserved skills. 
Their result was consistent with the quality sorting explanation, rather than with 
existence of discrimination. 
In this study, we apply the quality sorting approach of Hirsch and Macpherson 
(2004) to examine why wages of workers, immigrant and native alike, are considerably 
lower in occupations with high concentration of immigrants in Sweden. 
We use a unique Swedish longitudinal data set, Longitudinal Individual Data 
(LINDA), consisting of a large panel of representative individuals and their household 
members from 1968 to 2007. LINDA contains information regarding individuals' 
occupations at a three-digit level from 109 occupations. Having access to detailed 
occupational information is essential for a study like this. Another unique feature of this 
data set is having access to workers? contracted wages and thus avoiding measurement 
error in wages. Due to the longitudinal structure of LINDA, we create an unbalanced 
sample, in which we require individuals to be observed for at least two periods out of the 
possible nine.2  
                                                
2 Although certain information in LINDA is available for the period 1968 to 2007, detailed occupational 
data is only available after 1998. Hence, in this paper we will utilize data covering the period 1999 to 2007.

A potential problem of studying the relationship between wages and occupational 
features is that occupational attainment is endogenous. To control for this, we take 
advantage of the longitudinal nature of the data and utilize a fixed effects regression 
model. Our results indicate that estimates are sensitive to the choice of estimation 
strategy across demographic groups. In particular, the effect of immigration-based worker 
density on wages is reduced sharply when endogeneity of occupational attainment is 
controlled. An increase in immigrant density penalizes refugee workers the most, with 
each 10 percent increase in the proportion of immigrants in the workplace being 
associated with a 0.16 percent reduction in wages. The estimated wage effects are similar 
when refugee density of occupations is considered instead. Furthermore, when we 
investigate the relationship between wages and new immigrant composition or new 
refugee immigrant composition of occupations, we find that the wage penalties are even 
smaller.  
Overall, our results suggest that the negative relationship between wages and the 
proportion of immigrant workers in an occupation, observed in data, is almost entirely 
accounted for by measured and unmeasured worker skills. Consequently, these findings 
suggest that wage differences across occupations with different densities of immigrants 
are mainly due to quality sorting and to a lesser extent due to the existence of 
discrimination. 
We begin the paper with a discussion of theories on immigration-based 
occupational segregation in Section 2. We outline our econometric strategy for estimating 
the effect of immigrant density on wages in Section 3. The following section discusses 
the data and its relevant features. We next report the detailed results of our study. In a 
5 
 
final section of the paper, we summarise our findings and conclude with possible policy 
implications. 
2. Wages and occupational segregation  
Negative relationship between wages and the immigrant composition of 
occupations may be rationalised by one, or a combination, of the following alternative 
explanations:   
? Employers may choose not to hire immigrant workers because of their 
aversion towards such workers;  
? Employers may not be able to correctly assess immigrants? skill levels and 
may, therefore, assume that the proportion of high skilled workers is lower 
among immigrants than natives; or  
? The proportion of immigrant workers with high skills is actually less than 
that of native workers. 
Extending the simple quality sorting model presented in Hirsch and Macpherson 
(2004) illustrates the idea. Similar to Hirsch and Macpherson (2004), assume that there 
are two types of workers: low skilled and high skilled. Assume further that their marginal 
revenue products are L and H, respectively. Finally, PI and PN are the proportions of 
immigrant and native workers with productivity H, while (1-PI) and (1-PN) are the 
proportions of immigrant and native workers with productivity L. However, because the 
actual skill levels of immigrant workers are unknown to employers (or because they are 
averse to hiring such workers), the proportion of high skilled immigrant workers, PI, is 
not observed. Instead,  PI
* = PI - ?  is used, where ?  reflects the extent of uncertainty 
6 
 
about immigrants? skill levels. The average productivities or wages of immigrant and 
native workers,  VI  and  VN , respectively, are: 
 
 
VI = PI
*H + (1? PI
*)L
VN = PNH + (1? PN )L
 (1)  
while the average productivity across all workers is: 
 
  V = IMMD *VI + (1? IMMD) *VN  (2) 
where IMMD is the proportion of immigrants in the workplace.  
 Taking the derivative of V with respect to IMMD illustrates how wages may 
change as IMMD changes:  
 
 
?V
?IMMD
= PI ? ?( ) ? PN?? ?? * H ? L( )  (3) 
Assuming that H workers are always more productive than L workers, there are 
two ways the concentration of immigrants may negatively affect wages: First, in the 
absence of uncertainty of immigrants? skills  (? = 0) , the average wage decreases as the 
concentration of immigrants in the workplace increases if  PN > PI . This may be the case 
if a great deal of host-country specific human capital is required in the job, something 
immigrants have less of than natives (particularly upon arrival); Second, even if  PI = PN  
a negative relationship between wages and IMMD may arise if  ? > 0 . In this case, high 
skilled immigrant workers may be forced to work in low-skilled jobs receiving wages 
below their productivity levels, wages that are lower than those received by similarly 
skilled native workers.  
The above analysis may also be used to illustrate how immigrants? wages change 
with time spent in the host country. Let t denote time since arrival in the host country for 
7 
 
an immigrant and define  PIt
* = PIt - ?t . Thus, the perceived proportion of skilled 
immigrant workers changes over time, both because immigrants acquire host-country 
specific skills that are valued in the labour market (so that  PIt increase) and because 
employers learn about the true skill distribution of immigrants (so that  ?t  decrease). This 
also suggests that the effect of IMMD on wages depends on time since arrival. If IMMDA 
is a measure of the concentration of recent immigrants and IMMDB is a measure of the 
concentration of immigrants that have spent some time in the host country, then:  
 
 
?V
?IMMDA
>
?V
?IMMDB
 (4) 
 
With access to longitudinal data, it is possible to learn about the existence and, if 
present, the extent of discrimination against immigrants in the labour market. For 
instance, if the empirical results indicate that IMMD has no effect on wages after 
controlling for observed and unobserved worker attributes, it must be the case that  ? = 0  
(no discrimination or uncertainty) and  PI = PN  (no difference in skill distributions 
between immigrants and natives). On the other hand, if IMMD has a significant effect on 
wages, either  ? > 0  or  PN > PI . However, by assuming that access to longitudinal data 
enables us to fully control for differences in skill distributions through a fixed-effects 
model, a significant effect of IMMD must arise because  ? > 0 . 
We may also learn about changes in immigrant wages over time from longitudinal 
data. In particular, if the effect of IMMD depends on the immigrant cohort being used to 
define IMMD and if the effect is significant for recent immigrants but not for older 
immigrant cohorts, this would indicate that immigrants? earnings increase because their 
8 
 
skill levels increase or because employers learn about their true skill levels. Unless 
preference discrimination is a time-varying phenomenon, such a finding would not be 
consistent with the hypothesis that employers discriminate against immigrants.  
3. Empirical specification 
A potential problem in exploring the relationship between wages and the 
concentration of immigrants in an occupation is that occupational attainment is 
endogenous. There are at least two reasons for why this is the case: First, if immigrants 
and natives with higher unmeasured skills (captured by the error term in the wage 
equation) are more likely to be sorted into natives? jobs and those with lower skills into 
immigrants? jobs, then the exogeneity assumption will obviously be violated (note that 
this kind of sorting may result from employer discrimination); Second, the error term 
may also capture unobserved differences in preference among workers, which implies 
that the assumption of no correlation between the density of immigrants in an occupation 
and the error term can be violated.  
To avoid the potential problem with endogeneity, we apply a fixed-effects 
estimator. The advantage with such a procedure is that it differences out any time-
invariant unobserved (and observed) variables. Under the assumption that only the time-
invariant portion of the error term is correlated with proportion of immigrants in a given 
occupation, this procedure yields unbiased estimates of the effect of proportion of 
immigrants on wages. 
Another potential problem is that estimates of the parameter of the proportion of 
immigrants may be biased if the proportion of immigrants in a given occupation is 
9 
 
correlated with occupational-level wage determinants not included in the wage equation. 
Therefore, following Baker and Fortin (2001) and Hirsch Macpherson (2004), we not 
only include Xi measured at the individual level, but also the means of Xi at the 
occupational level, to control for omitted occupational wage determinants.  
Specifically, the relationship between wages and immigrant composition is 
estimated by:        
   
 
lnwit = ?k ? Xikt? + ? j ?Zijt? + ? ? IMMDit + ? it           (5) 
where lnwit is the log of hourly wage for individual i in year t, Xk consist of X1 = 1 and  
k?1 variables measuring personal characteristics measured at the individual level, ?k 
includes a constant and k?1 coefficients corresponding to variables in X, Zj includes 
occupation means of the X?s with ?j being the corresponding coefficients, IMMD is the 
proportion of immigrants to total employment in the worker?s detailed occupation, ? is 
the parameter on IMMD, measuring the elasticity of wages with respect to Immigrant 
Density.  
             The error structure is assumed to be:  
     ?it = ?i + ?it                     (6) 
where

4. Data 
The data used in the empirical analysis is drawn from the Swedish Longitudinal 
Individual Data (LINDA), supplied by Statistics Sweden. LINDA consists of a large 
10 
 
panel of representative individuals and their household members from 1968 to 2007. The 
first wave took place in 1994 when 300,000 individuals, which corresponds to about 3 
percent of the Swedish population, were drawn. These individuals were followed back to 
1968 but also forward, in order to create a panel that is updated annually. Each wave is 
cross section representative of the population, since new individuals replace individuals 
who leave (e.g. divorce, death, or emigration). For more information about LINDA, see 
Edin and Fredriksson (2000).    
The sample used in this study comes from the 1999 to the 2007 waves of LINDA. 
We use these waves from LINDA since information regarding individuals' occupations at 
a three-digit level is only available from 1999 and onwards.  
Another notable feature of this data set is the possibility of matching individual 
records with wage information provided by employers. Employers report monthly 
earnings to Statistics Sweden, expressed in full-time equivalents which gives the amount 
an individual would have earned if working full-time. To obtain hourly wage rates, the 
monthly earnings are divided by 165. The hourly wage rates obtained in this fashion 
correspond to the workers' contracted wages and are less likely to suffer from 
measurement errors, which are common in self-reported wages. 
We limit the analysis to males aged 18 to 64, excluding self-employed workers, 
students, and individuals with missing values on observed characteristics. After these 
selections we constructed an unbalanced sample, in which we required persons to be 
observed for at least two consecutive periods out of the possible nine.  
After the selections, the sample consists of 61,540 Swedish born males (and 
381,470 observations for these males), and of 6,883 male immigrants (36,668 
11 
 
observations). Just over half of the male immigrants were classified as refugee 
immigrants (3,665  individuals).  
We classify individuals who are foreign born and who arrived in Sweden after 
1968 as immigrants.5 Moreover, immigrants who were born in a refugee country, as 
classified by the Swedish Migration Board at the time of arrival, are defined as refugee 
immigrants.6 It should be noted that all immigrant households included in LINDA, 
including those defined as refugee immigrants in our study, have obtained residence 
permits. This means, for instance, that asylum seekers who are yet to obtain a residence 
permit are not included in LINDA.   
To construct the IMMD and the RIMMD variables, which measure the proportion 
of workers that are immigrants and refugee immigrants, respectively, in a given 
occupation, we use information from each of the waves of LINDA from 1999 to 2007. 
We have information regarding individuals' occupations at a three-digit level, and we can 
distinguish between 109 different occupations. For each occupation and year, we divide 
the number of immigrants working within that occupation by the total number of 
individuals working in that occupation (details of these 109 occupations are provided in 
Table A1). Since LINDA is representative of the population, it is likely that this measure 
of immigrant density reflects the true proportion of immigrants in different occupations.    
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics of the sample used in this paper. The 
evidence indicates that native workers have higher hourly wages; immigrant workers are 
                                                
5 We have no information on individuals prior to 1968. Thus, we cannot distinguish between Swedish-born 
individuals and individuals who were born outside Sweden but arrived before 1968. 
6 LINDA does not provide any information regarding actual refugee status. However, by using the 
countries defined by the Swedish Migration Board as refugee countries (which vary over time), along with 
information on country of birth as well as time of arrival in Sweden, we can obtain an approximate measure 
of refugee status. 
12 
 
more concentrated in urban areas and in occupations in which the proportion of 
immigrants are higher.  
In Table 2 we present a description of immigration-based occupational 
segregation in Sweden using the Duncan segregation index which is calculated separately 
for each cross-section by 
    
 
D = 0.5 ?

where Ai and Bi are the number of native and immigrant males in occupation i, 
respectively, and where i varies from 1 to n (the number of occupations), 
 
X = Ai
i=1
n
?  and 
 
Y = Bi
i=1
n
? . The measure D ranges between zero (complete integration) and one (complete 
segregation).  
The mean proportion of immigrants to total employment for native males in 
Sweden has gradually been increasing, from 6.9 percent in 1999 to 9.6 percent in 2007. 
The same pattern is observed for immigrant workers as well; the mean proportion of 
immigrants to total employment gradually increasing from 10 percent to 16 percent. 
These observations suggest that immigrants? participation rates in the Swedish labor 
market has increased over this period. However, the Duncan segregation index has also 
been increasing during the same period implying that the labor market ahs also become 
more segregated.  
In Table 3 we present evidence on occupational segregation among refugees. 
Calculations are again made for each cross-section wave of LINDA from 1999 to 2007. 
Since the mean proportion of all immigrants to total employment has gradually been 
13 
 
increasing, it is likely that the mean proportion of refugee immigrants to total 
employment has followed a similar pattern. Indeed, the entries in Table 3 confirms shows 
an increase in the mean proportion of refugee immigrants to total employment from 3.0 
percent in 1999 to 4.7 percent in 2007 for native male workers, and 6 percent in 1999 to 
10.4 percent in 2007 for male refugee workers. The Duncan segregation index is also 
increasing, suggesting that occupational segregation is also rising among refugee 
immigrants. As a point of comparison, the magnitudes of the Duncan segregation indices  
are higher than those reported by Hirsch and Macpherson (2004) for white and black 
male workers in the United States.  
In Tables 4 and 5 we present average wages across occupations that differ in 
terms of immigrant and refugee densities. We divide occupations into three categories 
based on the proportion of immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers in an occupation: 
occupations with less than nine percent immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers; 
occupations with nine to 16 percent immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers; and finally 
occupations with more than 16 percent immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers. For all 
immigrant groups, average wages are higher in occupations with low fractions of 
immigrant or refugee workers. In contrast, average wages are considerably lower in 
occupations  with a high proportion of immigrant or refugee. 
In Tables 6 and 7, we present similar wage information with the difference that 
immigrant density now reflects the proportion of immigrants that arrived after 1995 to 
total employment. Similarly, refugee density is calculated based on the proportion of 
refugee immigrants that arrived after 1995 to total employment. 
14 
 
Occupations are again divided into three categories based on the proportion of 
these relatively new immigrant or refugee workers in an occupation: occupations with 
less than four percent new immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers; occupations with four 
to nine percent immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers; and occupations with more than 
nine percent immigrant (refugee immigrant) workers. The entries in Table 6 shows that 
average wages for native workers are significantly higher in occupations with a high 
proportion of recent immigrants. The same is true for immigrant workers. A possible 
explanation for this observation is that these occupations include high-skilled jobs, such 
as professors at universities or computer experts in IT firms. Moreover, average wages 
for refugee workers are essentially the same in all three categories of occupations.  
When considering occupational categories based on proportion of new refugee 
workers, the earning pattern is reversed. Here, average wages are highest for all groups  
in occupations with low densities of new refugee workers and lowest in occupations with 
high densities.  
5. Empirical results 
Regression results from ordinary least squares and the fixed effects model are 
presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. The dependent variable is the logarithm of 
hourly wages and the explanatory variables used are age, age squared, number of 
children, marital status (e.g. single, married), highest educational attainment (e.g. high 
school, university), area of residence (e.g. urban area, rural area), years since arrival, 
years since arrival squared, and the immigrant density variables IMMD and RIMMD.  
15 
 
In addition to these observed and individual-specific characteristics we include 
average values of these characteristics by occupation. As mentioned above, these 
averages are included in an attempt to control for omitted occupational wage 
determinants. Finally, yearly time dummies and nine occupational variables (i.e. based on 
the first digit of the 3-digit code of the occupational codes in Table A1) are also included.  
We limit our presentation and discussion to the estimated coefficients of the 
density variables and the entries in Tables 8 and 9 show the effects of the density on log 
wages for four groups of workers; (1) immigrants, (2) refugee immigrants, (3) new 
immigrants, and (4) new refugee immigrant workers.7  
Estimates of the relationship between wages and the density variable IMMD are 
sensitive to the choice of estimation strategy across demographic groups. For example, 
the OLS estimate of the effect of IMMD on native wages is -0.386 which yields an 
elasticity of -0.031.8 Thus, a ten percent increase in the proportion of immigrants in an 
occupation is predicted to reduce natives? wages with around 0.3 percent. This effect is 
statistically significant. For all immigrants, regardless of source country, the wage 
elasticity is almost twice as high, -0.057, while for the group consisting of refugee 
immigrants only, the effect is -0.046. These findings are interesting given that the 
proportion of immigrant workers to total employment increased significantly during the 
time period considered in this paper. 
The relationship between wages and the density of refugee immigrants, 
represented by the variable RIMMD, are also presented in Table 8. The estimated wage 
                                                
7 The remaining estimates are available upon request. 
8 The elasticity is obtained, given the empirical specification, by multiplying the estimated coefficient  
(-0.386) with the average value of IMMD (0.08).  
16 
 
penalties associated RIMMD are similar to the wage penalties associated with IMMD. For 
natives, the elasticity is -0.032 while it is -0.060 for all immigrants and -0.051 for refugee 
immigrants. 
The final set of results presented in Table 8 show the wage effects from 
occupational changes in the proportion of recent immigrants. Although the magnitudes of 
the estimates are comparable and sometimes larger in (absolute value) than the estimates 
for immigrant densities using all immigrants, the corresponding elasticities are smaller 
than those reported above. For natives, the elasticity is -0.001 for IMMD and -0.008 for 
RIMMD. For all immigrants, the elasticity is -0.011 for IMMD and -0.015 for RIMMD 
while for refugee immigrants, the elasticities are -0.011 and -0.025 for IMMD and 
RIMMD, respectively. Thus, there is no evidence that the wage penalty associated with 
increased concentration of immigrants is higher when the measure represents recent 
immigrants. 
A major concern with the OLS results is the possibility that occupational choices 
are endogenously determined (i.e. those with high levels of unobserved labor market 
skills are also those who are most likely to choose high wage occupations). As is well 
known, presence of endogenous variables may seriously invalidate OLS regression 
coefficients. To address this issue, we utilize the longitudinal nature of the data and 
include individual-specific intercepts in the regression equation. This approach yields 
consistent estimates even if occupational choices are endogenous, assuming that these 
choices are only related to time-invariant and idiosyncratic effects (which are controlled 
for in this framework) but not to time-varying wage shocks.  
17 
 
These fixed-effects estimates are presented in Table 9. For all immigrant groups 
and for all measures of immigrant density, with one exception, the estimated wage 
penalties are significantly lower when the idiosyncratic and time-invariant effects are 
removed from the regression equation. For example, the wage elasticities for IMMD are -
0.012 for natives, -0.011 for all immigrants, and -0.016 for refugee immigrants. These 
figures are substantially smaller than those obtained using OLS reported above. This 
finding suggests that a large extent of the partial correlation, obtained by OLS, between 
wages and occupational concentration of immigrants is due to time-invariant, 
idiosyncratic characteristics of individuals. Consequently, these findings suggest that 
wage differences across occupations with different densities of immigrants are mainly 
due to quality sorting and to a lesser extent due to the existence of discrimination. 
The regression coefficients associated with working in jobs with high refugee 
densities are uniformly higher than those describing the wage penalty for working in jobs 
with high immigrant densities. This finding holds across all subgroups. However, the 
associated wage elasticities are roughly similar for both measures of immigrant density. 
The elasticities are -0.011 for native workers, -0.012 for immigrant workers, and -0.017 
for refugee immigrant workers. The corresponding wage elasticities obtained from the 
OLS estimates are -0.032 for natives, -0.060 for all immigrants and -0.051 for refugee 
immigrants. Thus, again the findings indicate that much of the observed wage differences 
across occupations with different concentrations of immigrants are mainly due to 
differences in unobserved (in the data) characteristics and to a lesser extent due to the 
existence of discrimination.

Regarding the wage effects from occupational changes in the proportion of recent 
immigrants, the fixed effects results presented in Table 9 are consistent with the OLS 
findings reported. Indeed, the magnitudes of the elasticities are even smaller than those 
obtained using OLS estimates. Consequently, there is little evidence suggesting that the 
wage penalty associated with increased concentration of immigrants is higher when the 
measure represents recent immigrants. 
Wage penalties on workers across demographic subgroups, evident from the 
results of our fixed effects model, illustrate that changes in any of the four densities we 
have considered cause refugee workers to suffer the most while the penalties are similar 
for natives and all immigrants. The estimated penalties associated with changes in 
immigrant density, modest as they are, imply that the negative relationship between 
wages and the proportion of immigrant workers in an occupation is almost entirely 
accounted for by measured and unmeasured worker skills. However, the results in Table 
9 indicate that there exists an effect of refugee immigrant composition on wages after 
accounting for worker heterogeneity. Discrimination may not be the driving force behind 
the negative correlation between wages and refugee density, but based on our results, it is 
not possible to completely rule it out.  
 Finally, analysis at finer levels of aggregation reveals some heterogeneity in the 
wage penalty for natives across subgroups. Depicting results from the fixed effects 
model, Table 10 illustrates how native workers with different educational attainment are 
affected differently by changes in immigrant worker density. Workers with higher 
educational attainment face higher penalties for working in jobs with higher immigrant 
density, relative to co-workers in jobs with lower immigrant density. These penalties, 
19 
 
however, are meager, albeit statistically significant. For example, the wage elasticity 
associated with a one percent increase in the density of refugee workers in their 
occupations is -0.014, somewhat larger than the effect obtained above that did not 
condition on educational attainment.11 Native workers that graduated from high school, 
or had not completed high school, face wage penalties that are lower and comparable in 
magnitudes to those reported above for the whole sample of natives.  
 
6. Conclusions  
This paper attempts to explain the negative relationship between immigrant 
composition of occupations and wages in Sweden. While there exist a number of studies 
devoted to the analysis of occupational gender segregation and its impact on the wage 
structure, there is little, if any, empirical evidence on occupational immigrant 
segregation. To purge our results from observed and unobserved worker characteristics, 
we take advantage of a unique longitudinal data source and apply fixed-effects regression 
techniques on these data. This strategy allows, under certain assumptions, for endogenous 
sorting into different jobs based on observed and unobserved skills. Occupational 
immigrant segregation is measured by analyzing the proportion of immigrants in 109 
different occupations. 
The effect of occupational segregation by immigration status is reduced sharply 
when endogeneity of occupational attainment is controlled for by using the fixed effects 
model. Estimated coefficients of our variable of interest, IMMD, from the fixed effects 
model (as well as the OLS estimates) are uniformly negative and comparatively much 
                                                
11 The elasticity was calculated using the information in Table A2 in appendix. 
20 
 
smaller. An increase in immigrant density penalises refugee workers the most, with each 
10 percent increase in IMMD associated with a 0.16 percent reduction in wages. The 
estimated wage effects are similar when refugee density of occupations is considered 
instead. Furthermore, when we investigate the relationship between wages and new 
immigrant composition or new refugee immigrant composition of occupations, we find 
that the wage penalties are even smaller.  
Overall, our results suggest that the negative relationship between wages and the 
proportion of immigrant workers in an occupation, observed in data, is almost entirely 
accounted for by measured and unmeasured worker skills. Consequently, these findings 
suggest that wage differences across occupations with different densities of immigrants 
are mainly due to quality sorting and to a lesser extent due to the existence of 
discrimination. 
Finally, our results suggest that a combination of strong efforts at enhancing 
training for immigrants, and particularly refugee immigrants, employer awareness 
programs and incentives for hiring immigrant workers, among other measures, may prove 
helpful to improve the state of  immigration-based employment and wage differentials in 
Sweden.
