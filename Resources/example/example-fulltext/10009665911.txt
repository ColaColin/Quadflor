Abstract 
Estimates of monopolistic markups are relatively scarce in the literature mostly due 
to lack of appropriate data and methodological difficulties, while their behaviour has 
important implications for the conduct of monetary policy. We estimate the 
monopolistic markups in the Polish economy in the period of 1995-2009 using 
Polish firm level data.. We show the association of the markup level with the 
sectoral characteristics, type of good produced and the form of ownership, as well as 
investigate the impact of both internationalization and competitive pressure on the 
level of markups. We show a somewhat puzzling and at the same time robust 
increase in markups after the EU accession of the Polish economy to the EU in 
2004. Moreover, in line with previous findings, we show that price cost margins are 
countercyclical with respect to the macroeconomic cycle and procyclical at sectoral 
level

Introduction 
Estimates of monopolistic markups are relatively scarce in the literature mostly due 
to lack of appropriate data and methodological difficulties. The estimates of markup 
level often play an important role in other economic tools such as macroeconomic 
simulation and forecasting models. What is probably even more important, 
especially in macroeconomic forecasts and in the conduct of monetary policy 
conduct is the response of markups to various external and internal shocks as well as 
their behaviour over the business cycle.  We aim to provide an up-to date picture of 
the distribution of markups in the economy ? both in the sectoral and time 
dimension. In this study, we estimate the monopolistic markups in the Polish 
economy in the period of 1995-2009 using Polish firm level data for most non-
financial sectors.  
Our estimates allow us to observe the behaviour of price cost margins over the 
business cycle. Moreover, we aim to assess the correlation of the level of markups 
with the form of firm ownership, including foreign ownership, and the degree of 
internationalization of firms proxied by the firm?s export status and export 
performance. We also verify the impact of the competitive pressure measured by the 
levels of industry concentration and import penetration on the level of markups.  We 
investigate whether markups have visibly changed after the EU accession of Poland 
in 2004. 
We apply a well-established methodology that allows for unbiased estimation of 
markups using firm-level data without the necessity to use instrumental variables in 
order to eliminate the impact of technological disturbances on the results of the 
estimation. Using the sectoral time-varying estimates, authors carried out a panel 
regression of markups on internal and external competition measures.  
Section one contains a short review of literature related to the estimation of 
monopolistic markups and related empirical studies. Section two provides outlines 
the empirical model. The third section describes the statistical data and the results of 
the estimation of monopolistic markups and  is followed by a short summary.

Introduction 
Estimates of monopolistic markups are relatively scarce in the literature mostly due 
to lack of appropriate data and methodological difficulties. The estimates of markup 
level often play an important role in other economic tools such as macroeconomic 
simulation and forecasting models. What is probably even more important, 
especially in macroeconomic forecasts and in the conduct of monetary policy 
conduct is the response of markups to various external and internal shocks as well as 
their behaviour over the business cycle.  We aim to provide an up-to date picture of 
the distribution of markups in the economy ? both in the sectoral and time 
dimension. In this study, we estimate the monopolistic markups in the Polish 
economy in the period of 1995-2009 using Polish firm level data for most non-
financial sectors.  
Our estimates allow us to observe the behaviour of price cost margins over the 
business cycle. Moreover, we aim to assess the correlation of the level of markups 
with the form of firm ownership, including foreign ownership, and the degree of 
internationalization of firms proxied by the firm?s export status and export 
performance. We also verify the impact of the competitive pressure measured by the 
levels of industry concentration and import penetration on the level of markups.  We 
investigate whether markups have visibly changed after the EU accession of Poland 
in 2004. 
We apply a well-established methodology that allows for unbiased estimation of 
markups using firm-level data without the necessity to use instrumental variables in 
order to eliminate the impact of technological disturbances on the results of the 
estimation. Using the sectoral time-varying estimates, authors carried out a panel 
regression of markups on internal and external competition measures.  
Section one contains a short review of literature related to the estimation of 
monopolistic markups and related empirical studies. Section two provides outlines 
the empirical model. The third section describes the statistical data and the results of 
the estimation of monopolistic markups and  is followed by a short summary.

Literature review 
The markup or a price cost margin (PCM) is the distance between firm?s price and 
marginal cost and is often measured by a Lerner index (difference between price and 
marginal cost relative to the price). The main difficulty in calculating the Lerner 
index directly is the unobservable marginal cost. One approach to overcoming this 
difficulty is to proxy the marginal cost with observable costs such as average cost or 
average variable cost (see eg. Tybout, 2003) if such data are available. Alternatively, 
Hall (1988) provides a method of estimation of the markup level from the Solow 
residual by decomposing the revenue-shares of inputs into the cost-share component 
and markup. The method was originally applied to aggregate data and since it 
requires demand-related instruments to account for the endogeneity of the input 
choices. A modification of the method to firm-level analysis was presented by Klette 
(1999) and it was applied by Gradzewicz and Hagemejer (2007a) to Polish data. The 
method proposed by Roeger (1995), extended by Oliveira-Martins and Scarpetta 
(1999) is based on difference between the primal and dual Solow residual and not 
only it solves the problem of endogeneity by eliminating the unobservables from the 
estimation equation but also requires only nominal revenue and cost data, which is 
usually the only type of data available at firm level. Several papers apply the Roeger 
method to firm level data and these include G?rg and Warzynski (2003), Konings et 
al. (2005), K?nings and Vandenbussche (2005) and G?rg and Warzynski (2006), 
Bellone et al. (2008 and 2009). By exploring the panel structure of firm-level 
datasets, the Roeger method can provide the time-varying markup estimates for 
groups of firms (eg. sectors).  
Some extensions to the Roeger method allow deviating from the original 
assumptions of constant returns to scale. These include Altug and Filztekin (2002) 
who analyze the primal and dual Solow residuals separately and are able to identify 
returns to scale using instrumental variables. Similar exercise has been performed by 
Konings, Roeger and Zhao (2011) to account for the existence of fixed factors of 
production. 
The literature is ambiguous on the direction of the response of price-cost margins to 
changes in the economic cycle. This response in the theoretical model varies with 
5 
the assumed market structure. Procyclical markups can result from price rigidity due 
to collusive agreements (eg. Athey, Bagwell and Sanchirico, 2004) or from 
competition regime switching depending on the degree of the capacity (Kreps and 
Scheinkman, 1983).  On the other hand, Rotemberg and Saloner (1984) show that in 
boom periods it may be optimal to cut margins and break the collusive agreement to 
realize larger profits. Procyclical markups are also found in Bils (1989) and 
Weitzman (1982). Rotemberg and Woodford (1999) provide a discussion on how 
the nature of collusive agreements affect the behavior of markups over time. 
As far as empirical studies are concerned, Bils (1987) points to procyclical markups. 
Countercyclical markups are found in Domovitz et al. 1986, Chirinko and Fazzari 
(1994). In  studies based on OECD data, Boulhol (2004) and Oliveira-Martins and 
Scarpetta (1996), similar results are obtained. More recent, firm-level evidence on 
the cyclical behaviour of markups is found  in G?rg and Warzynski (2006), who 
show pro-cyclical markups with respect to the industry-level cyclical position. 
Gradzewicz and Hagemejer (2007b, 2007c) show that in the period of 1996-2004, 
markups in the Polish economy were negatively correlated with the overall measure 
of the economic cycle, while procyclicality was found at the sectoral level. 
The relationship between the degree of competitiveness and the level of markups 
seems more established: lower industry concentration and more intensive import 
competition leads to lower markups. The impact of competition on markups was 
analysed by eg. Boulhol (2004) for OECD countries, Lundin (2004) for Sweden, 
Abraham et al, (2006) for Belgium. Some papers explore the effects of changes in 
the institutional environment. Konings et al show that  while in Romania and 
Bulgaria  competition reduces markups, higher price cost margins are associated 
with privatized and foreign owned firms. G?rg and Warzynski (2006) show that 
markups have fallen due to the Single Market Programme of 1992. Boulhol (2006) 
finds evidence that markups increased over time in OECD countries over thirty 
years due to declining bargaining power on the part of workers despite 
intensification of competition in the product markets.  
Markups can also be related to firm-level export status may be related to markups 
through access to larger markets, productivity improvements and quality upgrading

Methodology 
The Roeger (1995) method is based on an assumption that firm?s technology is 
described by the following homogeneous of first degree production function: 
,),,...,(),,,...,( 11 EKXXFEKXXY NN =  (1) 
where K  denote firms? stock of fixed assets and iX ?s denote all remaining 
production inputs employed in the production process and E  measures a Hicks-
neutral technical progress (total factor productivity). Log differentiation of equation

Assuming that input markets behave in a perfectly competitive fashion, 
prices of production factors are equal to the value of their respective marginal 
product corrected by the markup of the producing firm. We assume that the size of 
the markup is the same for all factors and is equal to the markup of price over 
marginal cost (MC). Let r  and iw  denote respectively the prices of capital and other 
inputs, P ? the price of final good and ?  - the markup over marginal cost (

As all the variables in equation 14 are observable, the equation can be estimated 
using ordinary least square. Another advantage of this specification is the fact that 
all the output and input variables are expressed in nominal terms, removing the need 
for price deflators which are difficult to obtain at sectoral level and unavailable at 
firm level in most cases. 
Equation (14) can rewritten for the purpose of estimation as: 
ttt xy ?? +?=? , (15) 
where  ty?  is the log approximation of the left handside of equation 14 and tx? is 
the log approximation of the term in square brackets on the right handside of 
equation 14, ?  is the estimate of the markup and t? is the error term.  
Equation 14 can be augmented with exogenous explanatory variables, in order to 
capture the impact of changing economic environment. We follow Oliveira-Martins 
and Scarpetta (1999), and assume that markups depend on the economic cycle in the 
following fashion:

In the above equation, E
dE  is unobservable, therefore if ?  is estimated using 
standard methods, it is likely to be biased due to omitted variables. While the 
problem can be solved by using instrumental variables, Roeger (op. cit.), solves this 
problem by using an estimator based on a difference between primal and dual Solow 
residuals. 
The cost function corresponding to the production function (1) is of the form:

As all the variables in equation 14 are observable, the equation can be estimated 
using ordinary least square. Another advantage of this specification is the fact that 
all the output and input variables are expressed in nominal terms, removing the need 
for price deflators which are difficult to obtain at sectoral level and unavailable at 
firm level in most cases. 
Equation (14) can rewritten for the purpose of estimation as: 
ttt xy ?? +?=? , (15) 
where  ty?  is the log approximation of the left handside of equation 14 and tx? is 
the log approximation of the term in square brackets on the right handside of 
equation 14, ?  is the estimate of the markup and t? is the error term.  
Equation 14 can be augmented with exogenous explanatory variables, in order to 
capture the impact of changing economic environment. We follow Oliveira-Martins 
and Scarpetta (1999), and assume that markups depend on the economic cycle in the 
following fashion:

where ? is a fixed component of markup (average markup over time), tCYCL  is a 
measure of the business cycle and ?  pinpoints the relationship between the cyclical 
position of the economy and the level of markups. Oliveira-Martins et al. (op. cit) 
show that in this case the estimating equation becomes: 
tttttt CYCLxCYCLxy ??? +?+??+?=? )( . (17) 
Similarly, we can use the general formula: 
tttttt ZxZxy ???? +?+?+?=? . (17) 
to examine the interaction between markups and other exogenous, time-varying 
variables.  tZ  can include sectoral export and import intensity, as well as 
concentration ratios, but also firm-level characteristics. For example, following 
Goerg and Warzynski (2003), we include the firm-level export dummy to compare 
the levels of markups between exporters and nonexporters. Due to a panel structure 
of the sample, it is possible to interact tx?  with both time and sectoral dummies to 
explore the relevant variation of the markup estimate. 
Moreover, the Roeger formula makes it also possible to estimate markups at firm 
level provided that there is enough observations for a given firm. However, for 
identification purposes, it is required to assume that, at the firm level, markups are 
either constant over all the years in the sample or over periods of time. Given the 
fact that the time span of our dataset is limited, we make the former assumption.

Dataset and variables definition 
In this paper, we employ firm-level data based on the financial statements of Polish 
non-financial sector (companies with over 50 employees), collected by Polish 
Central Statistical Office.  The data cover the period between 1995 and 2009. 
We correct the firm?s revenues by inventory investment and costs of taxes. Costs are 
disaggregated to the costs of energy, costs of materials3, costs of labor4 and the costs 
of capital.  
Costs of capital are based on the concept by Jorgenson and Griliches (1967) and 
extended by e.g. Oulton and Srinivasan (2003).  The stream of capital services can 
be measured as a cost of renting capital for production purposes and presented as 
follows: 
ititttit Krk ?+?= )( ?pi
itk  is the measure of capital services, tr  is the rate of return, tpi  is a value-added 
deflator, (so tr -  tpi is the real rate of return) it?  is the depreciation rate and itK  is 
the stock of fixed assets of the firm. The rate of return is proxied by the yield on 5Y 
government bond. Depreciation rate has been determined at the level of an 
enterprise, as a ratio of the depreciation value to the fixed assets in purchasers? 
prices, while the fixed assets cover both tangible and intangible assets, measured as 
the average from values at the beginning and the end of the year.
Total number of observations in the initial dataset amounts to over 275 thousand. 
We subject the data to filtering as erroneous observations are common in these kinds 
of datasets. We dropped observations where employment, labor cost, capital or 
output were negative or where capital or labor efficiency were extremely high 
(deviation of logarithm of a particular value by a company exceeded the logarithm 
of average value for their NACE class by three). In order to get rid of influential 
outliers, we have also excluded from the sample one percent of extreme top and one

percent of extreme bottom observations of dx and dy, directly used in the regression 
of margins. 
Our dataset is an unbalanced panel. The estimating procedure requires the 
subsequent year pairs to be balanced in order to calculate the required first 
differences. This fact, together with the trimming procedure above, has reduced the 
sample to roughly 165 thousand observations. 
We perform the analysis for different groups of entreprises. The markups are 
estimated separately for manufacturing and services. Due to changes in the NACE 
classification, we are able to pinpoint consistently only major service industries, 
where changes in the classification were not fundamental (wholesale and retail trade; 
repair, transportation and storage, hotel and restaurants etc).  
We are also able to differentiate markup estimates by forms of ownership: private 
domestic, multi-national corporations or state-owned companies. Using the firm-
level data we calculate Herfindahl-Hirschman (HHI) concentration index within 4-
digit NACE industries in order to account for the level of competition. Moreover, 
we distinguish four types of goods: investment goods, intermediate goods, durable 
consumer goods or non-durable consumer goods, in order to capture the potential of 
heterogeneity of markups in this dimension. 
We also explore the importance of international trade for both the sectoral and firm-
level composition of margins. The export activity of firms is quantified in two ways. 
On the extensive margin we classify the entreprises as exporters and non-exporters, 
on the basis of their export sales. We also look at the intensive margin, by 
incorporating the export intensity of an exporter, defined as the ratio of export sales 
to total sales, in the markup estimation equation. 
Import penetration is measured at the sectoral level. We have used the data on 
imports of goods from the UN COMTRADE database (expressed in USD and in the 
SIC nomenclature). This data is further converted to NACE sectors and into Polish 
zloty using average market exchange rates. We obtain a synthetic measure of import 
intensity by division of total imports by total sales of a NACE 3-digit group, what 
allows us to divide the groups of companies into more or less affected by import 
competition.  
13 
In the analysis we measured also connection between the business cycle and level of 
markups. We used GDP as a proxy for the cyclical position of the economy and 
value added (in constant prices) in every sector and alternatively every division (by 
2-digit NACE classification)5 to create two types of sectoral cycles measures. We 
reconstructed this series by taking logarithms and subtracting long run trends 
approximated by HP filter. Due to recent changes in the NACE classification 
consistent data about value added from sectors and divisions are available until year 
2008, and therefore the analysis of markup behavior over the economic cycle is 
limited to the period of 1995-2008.

In the overall sample the estimate of the price cost margin amounts to 7.8%. The 
PCM varies over time. It ranges from 4.7% in 1996 to 10.7% in 2009. The data 
reveal that markups have visibly increased after 2004, what happened despite 
increased openness and greater potential competition connected with EU accession. 
In the entire period of estimation PCMs were significantly higher in manufacturing 
(9.1%), than in services (4.8%). But significant discrepancies also exist between 
specific service sectors. The PCMs for the trade and repair, the largest service 
section, amount to 3.3%, whereas in transportation and storage the estimate stands at 
6.1% and in hotel and restaurants at 10.1%. 
The PCMs are also heterogonous across different forms of ownership. The 
subsidiaries of multinational companies exhibit the highest markups. Among 
domestic firms the state-owned enterprises reveal a higher level of markups than 
private enterprises, but this result can be attributed to structural differences between 
those groups. When we estimate the PCMs for manufacturing only, the estimates for 
multinationals remain the highest, but markups in the state-owned firms and of firms 
owned by local governments, are significantly lower than those of private domestic 
units. 
We also estimated the PCMs for different types of manufactures (investment, 
intermediate, durable consumer goods and non-durable consumer goods) based on 
the OECD 3-digit classification of NACE sectors. PCMs turn out to be higher for 
investment and intermediate goods, than for consumer goods, both durable and non-
durable.

Cyclicality of price cost margins 
The analysis of the impact of business cycle on price cost margins (PCMs) are 
presented in table 1. The interpretation of results shown in Table 3 should be 
following. PCMs are pro-cyclical if the estimated parameter at the interaction of dx 
and cycle measure is significant and positive. Similarly, PCMs are countercyclical if 
the estimate is significantly negative. In table 3 and in all subsequent tables, we 
suppress the irrelevant regression results, such as constants and other included 
variables that lack economic interpretation. 
The results show that the general economic cycle is negatively correlated with the 
level of markups, while the sectoral cycles of economic activity seems to be 
positively correlated with the level of markups. However statistical significance of 
those results depends on the specification of the estimated equations.  
Therefore the economic cycle, measured by the deviation of GDP from its long run 
trend is not a significant driver of PCMs, unless we control for the sectoral cycles.

According to our estimates the impact is highly economically significant. An 
increase in GDP deviation from its long run trend by 1 pp. is associated with a 
decrease in PCMs by 0.14 or 0.15 pp., depending on the definition included in the 
regression.

Gradzewicz et al. (2010) show that industrial output and the variations in external 
demand are highly correlated and is generally much more variable than consumption 
demand where the length of the cycle is also much longer. We try to establish 
whether  the type of good produced in a sector has an impact on the cyclical 
behavior of markups, with a idea in mind that production of investment and 
intermediate goods is more susceptible to cyclical variations than that of 
consumption goods (especially consumer non-durables). We therefore expect that in 
investment and intermediate goods producing sectors, demand is driven by the 
enterprise sector itself and by the external demand and therefore the sectoral cycle 
could serve as an approximation of relevant demand variations. At the same time, 
we could expect that the deviations in the overall GDP cycle should reflect 
variations in overall demand in the economy and therefore be a better proxy for 
changes in consumer demand.

The level of markups clearly depends on the type of good produced by a company 
(the division into main product groups is available for manufacturing only). The 
highest markups are found among the producers of investment and intermediate 
goods: over 10%, while the margins by producers of both consumer durable and 
non-durable goods are below 8%. Also the impact of economic cycle on PCMs by 
those groups of companies is differentiated. GDP cycle is negatively correlated to 
markups of producers of all sorts of goods besides consumer non-durables. The 
biggest quantitative ?impact? the economic cycle has on the level of markups by the 
producers of consumer durable goods. An increase of GDP deviation from its long 
run trend by 1% is associated with decrease of markups by about 0.5% of durable 
consumer goods producers.  
As far as the sector or division level cycles are concerned, markups set by producers 
of investment and intermediate goods turns out to be statistically pro-cyclical. 
Though the estimate of the elasticity parameter for producers of intermediate goods 
is very low and doesn?t have greater economic significance.

Markups and exporting activity 
We also explore the association between markups and export activity of entreprises. 
Previous literature (eg. G?rg and Warzynski, 2003) have found a positive correlation 
between the export and markups. We explore this subject in two ways, ie. we divide 
entreprises in our sample into categories based on the share of exports in total sales 
and alternatively, we include an interaction of export share in total sales and the dx
variable in the markups estimation equation. 
The results show that exporters are characterized by a markup that is on average 
about 2.6 pp. higher than in the case of non-exporters (column 1 of Table 4). In 
manufacturing, the premium is closer to 2 pp (column 6). The significant exporter 
premium is not largely affected by accounting for the sector specificity by including 
a interaction between the dx variable and 3-digit sectoral dummies (sectoral 
estimates are not shown).

Moreover, the subsequent categories of firms characterized by higher export share, 
have significantly higher markups than the categories with low export share (column 
3 for the overall sample and column 8 for manufacturing). The positive relationship 
is preserved when only the exporters are taken into account (columns 4 and 8). 
In order to account for possible non-linearities in the relationship, we compare the 
groups of firms based on their export performance (within exporters). In the overall 
sample, there are significant differences between the compared percentiles of firms 
(except the case of the comparison between the second and third group). PCM 
estimate for a subsample up to 10th percentile in the export share is about 3 pp. 
lower than a similar estimate for a subsample with export share in and over the 90th 
percentile. In manufacturing, however, the differences are less visible for firms with 
export shares below the 50th percentile. Significant differences exist for firms within 
the range of 50th and 90th percentile with no visible extra premium of being in the 
90th percentile. The difference in PCMs between the manufacturing firms subsample 
up to 10th percentile in the export share is about 2 pp. lower than a similar estimate 
for a subsample with export share in and over the 90th percentile. 
These results are consistent with the estimates of interaction the interaction term of 
the dx variable with the export share: they indicate that the increase of export share 
by 1 pp. results in  increase of PCMs by about 0.03 pp. (0.025 pp. in manufacturing). 
Another interesting issue is the impact of exchange rate on the markup level. In 
order to check, if it is a significant factor affecting markups, we included the level of 
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) in the markup regressions. The results 
suggest a negative correlation between strength of national currency and PCMs by 
both, exporters, where this impact is stronger, and non-exporters. However when we 
control for the level of economic activity (total and sectoral or division) this effect 
weakens for exporters, and become insignificant for non-exporters.

Unless we control for the economic cycle, the strength of negative correlation 
between the exchange rate and PCMs is also different among specified groups of 
exporters characterized by grade of export intensity. Our results confirm that the 
higher export intensity the bigger negative impact of NEER on markups (excluding 
one group of exporters, between p25 and p50, where NEER seem to be insignificant 
factor explaining level of PCMs). However this result disappears when we include 
in regression variables quantifying economic cycle, what can be attributed to some 
correlation between levels of economic activity end exchange rate.

Moreover, the subsequent categories of firms characterized by higher export share, 
have significantly higher markups than the categories with low export share (column

These results are consistent with the estimates of interaction the interaction term of 
the dx variable with the export share: they indicate that the increase of export share 
by 1 pp. results in  increase of PCMs by about 0.03 pp. (0.025 pp. in manufacturing). 
Another interesting issue is the impact of exchange rate on the markup level. In 
order to check, if it is a significant factor affecting markups, we included the level of 
nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) in the markup regressions. The results 
suggest a negative correlation between strength of national currency and PCMs by 
both, exporters, where this impact is stronger, and non-exporters. However when we 
control for the level of economic activity (total and sectoral or division) this effect 
weakens for exporters, and become insignificant for non-exporters.

Unless we control for the economic cycle, the strength of negative correlation 
between the exchange rate and PCMs is also different among specified groups of 
exporters characterized by grade of export intensity. Our results confirm that the 
higher export intensity the bigger negative impact of NEER on markups (excluding 
one group of exporters, between p25 and p50, where NEER seem to be insignificant 
factor explaining level of PCMs). However this result disappears when we include 
in regression variables quantifying economic cycle, what can be attributed to some 
correlation between levels of economic activity end exchange rate.

Price cost margins and the intensity of competition 
We consider a straightforward hypothesis of a negative impact of the intensity of 
competition on the level of markups. We use two measures of both internal and 
external competition. We proxy the level of competition by a Herfindahl-Hirschman 
concentration index and the external competition by the ratio of imports in every 3-
digit NACE group to total sales of firms located in Poland within the same sector. 
The results confirm that higher market concentration, leads to a higher level of 
markups - the parameter estimate of the interaction term of HHI and dx is positive 
and statistically significant, for the overall sample and manufacturing. Including 3-
digit dummies interactions with the dx variable and therefore correcting for industry 
specificity does not affect the obtained estimators. Furthermore, average PCM for 
the 10% of companies that are located in a sector  with the lowest HHI, amounts to 
5.2% and is about 4 pp. lower then average PCM for the sectors with top 10% 
concentration. The results for manufacturing prove to be similar. 
Due to the suspected low reliability of the sectoral import data, we decided to only 
report the group comparison based on the levels of import penetration. There seems 
to exist no linear relation between our import measure and markups. Though one 
fact should be stressed- in the group of 10% companies with the lowest import 
penetration measure, which means that in the manufacturing sectors with the lowest 
level of imports, the price cost margins are significantly higher than in other sectors.

Price cost margins and the EU integration

interaction with the dx variable in order to capture the effect associated with EU 
integration. In columns 1 and 5, we provide results of a simple regression containing 
just the interaction term, whereas in subsequent columns we include some of the

It is important to note, that the conclusions concerning the direction of both cyclical 
and competition affects remain largely unaffected. However, the estimated 
difference in the average markup after the Polish integration with the EU is positive 
and varies between 1.9 and 2.5 percentage points and proves to be somewhat robust, 
indicating that markups have increased significantly after 2004, even when cyclical 
effects are taken into accounts. What is even more interesting is that, in fact, the 
post-2004 markup premium proves to be higher for non-exporters than it is for 
27 
exporters (in fact, it is more than twice as high). The increase in the post-2004 
premium for exporters is not surprising ? Polish companies gained access to a much 
larger market than they had access to before together with lower barriers to imports 
of intermediate goods. At the same time, the import competition factor must have 
turned out to be relatively weak, at least as far as the level of markups are 
concerned. The reason why non-exporters increased markups to a larger extent, 
might be at least two-fold: first, the exporting industries are also expected to import 
more and therefore face stronger competition and second, with the expansion of the 
Polish economy, the growth of domestic demand, especially for higher markup 
luxurious groups may have been higher than the growth of external demand in the 
years following the EU accession. However, both hypotheses remain so far untested.

Adjustment for returns to scale 
The Roeger analysis can be extended by allowing for returns to scale. In this case, 
?  in equaition (7) will take the form: ,1 ?
?
?
=? where ? is the scale elasticity. 
Following the Dobrinski et al. (2006), we correct the estimates using scale 
elasticities obtained for the same sample by Gradzewicz and Hagemejer (2007a).  
The estimating equation is transformed to become: 
,1 tttt xxy ??? +??=???
Each observation of the explanatory variable is multiplied by the sectoral estimate of 
scale elasticity (time-invariant). Selected results of those corrections (after 
recalculating the Lerner index in the usual form) are given in the table Table 9.  
Due to the fact that economies of scale are more important in manufacturing, the 
corrected average markup is higher in that sector, while it is almost unchanged in 
services and the remaining sectors. A closer look on the service sector shows that 
the only estimate that is visibly affected is the transport sector, where decreasing 
returns to scale are present and therefore the sector is close to marginal cost pricing. 
Correction for returns to scale intensifies the difference between the foreign- and 
domestically-owned firms due to the fact that foreign owned-firms are more likely to 
locate in increasing returns to scale sectors. 
The correction for returns to scale does not alter the conclusions on the cyclical 
behavior of markups nor the effects of EU integration or involvement in 
international trade in a significant way.

Following the Dobrinski et al. (2006), we correct the estimates using scale 
elasticities obtained for the same sample by Gradzewicz and Hagemejer (2007a).  
The estimating equation is transformed to become: 
,1 tttt xxy ??? +??=???
Each observation of the explanatory variable is multiplied by the sectoral estimate of 
scale elasticity (time-invariant). Selected results of those corrections (after 
recalculating the Lerner index in the usual form) are given in the table Table 9.  
Due to the fact that economies of scale are more important in manufacturing, the 
corrected average markup is higher in that sector, while it is almost unchanged in 
services and the remaining sectors. A closer look on the service sector shows that 
the only estimate that is visibly affected is the transport sector, where decreasing 
returns to scale are present and therefore the sector is close to marginal cost pricing. 
Correction for returns to scale intensifies the difference between the foreign- and 
domestically-owned firms due to the fact that foreign owned-firms are more likely to 
locate in increasing returns to scale sectors. 
The correction for returns to scale does not alter the conclusions on the cyclical 
behavior of markups nor the effects of EU integration or involvement in 
international trade in a significant way.

Firm-level price cost margins 
In order to observe the shape of the distribution of markups and to provide another 
robustness check, we measure markups at firm level (for firms with minimum of 10 
observations). Observation of obtained markup distribution (Epanechnikov kernel 
densities) of the graphs confirms most of the previous conclusions.  The average 
obtained level of markups is 8.5% which is in line with the previous result. 
Distribution of markups is more concentrated than the normal distribution and is 
positively skewed.  
On average PCMs in manufacturing are higher than in services, with the average 
markup in manufacturing equal to 9.7%, while in services the markup amounts to 
5.1%. The distribution of markups in manufacturing has a large part of its mass 
concentrated to the right of the respective distribution for services and is less 
concentrated and more symmetric. 
As far as ownership impact is concerned, while the distribution of the privately-
owned domestic firms is visibly shifted to the left, the markups of state-owned firms 
and multinationals are roughly in line. The average markup for privately-owned 
firms amounts to 7.2%, for state-owned 10.5% and for multinationals 12.4%. The 
distribution of markups in privately-owned domestic firms is the most concentrated 
and also less skewed then of the others groups. 
The shape of the distribution suggests that only producer of nondurable consumer 
goods are characterized by lower markups than the others, but values of mean 
estimates confirm that producers of both durable and non-durable goods set lower 
markups (8.8% and 7.4% respectively) than producers of investment and 
intermediate goods (10.8% and 11.9% respectively). The most concentrated are the 
markups of firms producing investment goods. 
Distribution of PCMs for exporters is shifted to the right with respect to those of 
non-exporters which confirms the existence of the export premium. The average 
markup estimate for exporters amounts to 10.8%, while for non-exporters it is 7.5%. 
Also the export intensity is positively related to height of markups. The average 
markup of exporters with over 50% share of export sales amounts to 11.6%, while of 
the exporters with domination of domestic sales, 9.7%. The distribution of markups 
31 
within the non-exporter group is more concentrated than that of exporters and the 
distribution of margins of exporters with lower export share is more concentrated 
than that of exporter with higher share of exports in sales. 
The results confirm also that PCMs of companies operating in more concentrated 
markets are on average higher than those of remaining firms. Average markup 
estimated for companies that operate in markets characterized by the HHI index 
exceeding the median value amounts to 9.5%, and average markup of the remaining 
firms is smaller by at least 2 pp. Kurtoses of distribution of markups by these groups 
are similar, but the skewness of the distribution of markups firms operating in more 
concentrated markets is higher.  
Also our measure of import penetration seems to play significant role in effecting 
markups. Though the shapes of distributions are not very suggestive, the average 
markup for companies operating in the markets characterized by the import 
penetration index below 10th percentile amounts to 13.2% and is by over 3 pp. 
higher analogous value for the rest of firms. The skewness and kurtosis are similar 
in these groups.

Conclusions 
In this paper, we have presented a set of up-to date estimates of monopolistic 
markups for the Polish economy. Our findings confirm the conclusions of much 
earlier studies performed for Poland even given the somewhat longer history of the 
available dataset. Our results confirm that the cyclical behavior of the price cost 
margin is visible only when both sectoral and macroeconomic cycles with a 
countercyclical reaction to the macroeconomic cycle and a pro-cyclical reaction to 
the economic situation in the relevant section or division. Our methodology allows 
us to compare groups of firms based both firm-level and sectoral characteristics. The 
form of ownership affects the level of markups with the clear premium of 
multinationals and selected form of state ownership. We show that there is a 
considerable variation of markups depending on the type of good produced 
classified by its use (consumer goods producers have lower markups than eg. 
investment good producers) and it also turns out that there is a heterogeneity as far 
as response to the cycle is concerned..  
We assess the impact of pressure from both internal from external competition on 
the level of markups as well as the association of markups with the export status and 
export performance. Markups are also sensitive to changes in exchange rates. 
Appreciation of Polish Zloty is associated with a fall in markups that is more  
pronounced in exporters.  
While in sectors that are more concentrated and more open to imports markups are 
lower, export participation tends to be correlated with higher markups. These results 
are also confirmed by the firm-level analysis of the markup level. 
While markups vary considerably over time in the analyzed period, we observe a 
robust increase of their level after the accession to the EU in 2004. We are not able 
to tie this results to increased export participation and the cyclical position of the 
economy in that period. Moreover, effects of EU integration are more pronounced in 
the domestic market-oriented sectors suggesting important wealth effects of EU 
accession.
