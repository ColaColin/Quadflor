US Disposable Personal Income and Housing 
Price Index: A Fractional Integration Analysis 
 
 
Abstract 
 
This paper examines the relationship between US disposable personal income (DPI) and 
house price index (HPI) during the last twenty years applying fractional integration and long-
range dependence techniques to monthly data from January 1991 to July 2010. The empirical 
findings indicate that the stochastic properties of the two series are such that cointegration 
cannot hold between them, as mean reversion occurs in the case of DPI but not of HPI. Also, 
recursive analysis shows that the estimated fractional parameter is relatively stable over time 
for DPI whilst it increases throughout the sample for HPI. Interestingly, the estimates tend to 
converge toward the unit root case after 2008 once the bubble had burst. The implications for 
explaining the recent financial crisis and choosing appropriate policy actions are discussed.

1. Introduction 
 
Real estate bubbles are a controversial topic in economics. Whether it is possible to 
identify them and whether policy-makers should act to prevent them is a hotly debated 
issue. Mainstream economists argue that central banks should only target inflation and 
counter-cyclical monetary and fiscal policy should be adopted to smooth the wealth effects 
of bubbles only once they have occurred. In particular, in their view by adopting inflation 
targeting and focusing on inflationary or deflationary pressures, a central bank effectively 
minimises the negative side effects of short-run, extremely volatile asset prices, without 
having to target them directly (see, e.g., Bernanke and Gertler, 2001). 
However, in a more recent study, Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) argued that the 
stock market is an independent source of macroeconomic volatility to which policy makers 
might need to respond in order to reduce inflation volatility, and the same might of course 
apply to other types of asset prices such as house prices. Cartensen (2004) and Cecchetti et 
al. (2000) also took the view that policy makers should give more consideration to asset 
price movements to reduce the risk of economic instability resulting from boom and bust in 
business cycles. Cecchetti et al., (2000), for example, argued that monetary authorities 
should take into account asset price movements with the aim of achieving macroeconomic 
stability.   
Concerning house prices in particular, Post-Keynesian economists emphasise that 
bubbles lead to higher borrowing against increasing property values, and therefore to 
higher levels of debt the burden of which increases when the bubble bursts and property 
prices collapse, which reduces aggregate consumption and demand causing a fall in 
economic activity (this is the so-called debt deflation theory initially developed by Fisher, 
1933); they suggest therefore that in order to avoid such a scenario methods should be 
developed to identify bubbles and policy actions taken to prevent them or to deflate 
existing ones. Various housing market indicators have in fact been constructed with the 
aim of detecting possible bubbles. These include housing affordability measures, housing 
debt measures, housing ownership and rent measures, as well as housing price indices. Of 
the latter, one of the most commonly used in the US is the HPI produced by the Federal 
Housing Finance Agency. 
Even before the US housing bubble which led to the financial crisis starting in 2007 
there had been a lot of interest in the behaviour of house prices in the OECD countries, 
given their sharp increase since the 1990s. Some studies had expressed the concern that the 
observed divergence between house prices and fundamentals driving them, in particular 
household income, indicated the existence of a bubble (see, e.g., Case and Shiller, 2003 
and McCarthy and Peach, 2004). Other authors had previously highlighted the fact that the 
macroeconomic effects of bubbles can differ considerably across countries depending on 
their housing and financial market institutions (see Maclennan et al., 1998) or the linkages 
between housing and labour markets (see Meen, 2002).   
The subprime mortgage crisis starting in the US in 2007 has made the issue of the 
relationship between disposable personal income (DPI) and the housing price index (HPI) 
even more crucial, since there is wide agreement that the significant discrepancy between 
these two variables in the US was one of the main factors triggering off a global financial 
crisis of unprecedented severity. 
From an econometric point of view, the existence of a long-run relationship 
between these two variables implies that they should be cointegrated, namely that, 
although the two individual series might be nonstationary I(1), there exists a linear 
combination of the two which is stationary I(0). This paper uses US monthly data to test 
whether this holds empirically. We carry out long-range dependence tests which allow for 
fractional degrees of differentiation (including the special cases of 1 and 0 degrees of 
integration). The main finding of our analysis is that cointegration cannot hold between 
these two series since they exhibit different degrees of integration. Specifically, DPI is 
found to be I(d) with 0.5 < d < 1 (d being the fractional degree of differentiation), implying 
that it is nonstationary but mean-reverting. On the contrary, in the case of HPI, d is strictly 
above 1, with a value around 1.4, implying that this series is both nonstationary and non-
mean-reverting. Thus, while the effects of shocks to DPI will tend to disappear in the long 
run, those to HPI have permanent effects, and require decisive policy measures to bring 
about mean reversion. We also investigate whether this is a consequence of the crisis of 
2007 or it has its origins in an earlier period. For this purpose we implement recursive 
procedures from 2000 till the end of the sample in 2010. 
The layout of the paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines the econometric 
methodology. Section 3 describes the data and presents the empirical results. Section 4 
offers some concluding remarks. 
 
 
2. Econometric Methodology 
In this paper we characterise the nonstationarity of the series in terms of a long memory 
process. Two definitions of long memory can be adopted, one in the time domain and the 
other in the frequency domain. 
Let us consider a zero-mean covariance stationary process { tx , ,...1,0 ±=t } with 
autocovariance function )( uttu xxE +=γ . The time domain definition of long memory states 
that ∞=∑∞
−∞=u
uγ . Now, assuming that xt has an absolutely continuous spectral distribution, 
so that it has spectral density function

⎛ ∑+= ∞

uf λγγπλ    (1) 
the frequency domain definition of long memory states that the spectral density function is 
unbounded at some frequency λ in the interval [ π,0 ). Most of the empirical literature has 
concentrated on the case where the singularity or pole in the spectrum takes place at the 0-
frequency. This is the case of the standard I(d) models of the form:

where L  is the lag-operator ( 1−= tt xLx ) and tu  is ( )0I .1 However, fractional integration 
may also occur at other frequencies away from 0, as in the case of seasonal/cyclical 
models. 
Note that the polynomial (1–L)d in (2) can be expressed in terms of its Binomial 
expansion, such that, for all real d,

In this context, d plays a crucial role since it is an indicator of the degree of 
dependence of the time series: the higher the value of d is, the higher the level of 
association will be between the observations. Processes with d > 0 in (2) display the 
property of “long memory”, with the autocorrelations decaying hyperbolically slowly and 
the spectral density function being unbounded at the origin. If d = 0 in (2), xt = ut, and the 
series is I(0). If d belongs to the interval (0, 0.5) the series is still covariance stationary but 
the autocorrelations take a longer time to disappear than in the I(0) case. If d is in the 
interval [0.5, 1) the series is no longer stationary; however, it is still mean-reverting in the 
sense that the effects of shocks disappear in the long run. Finally, if d ≥ 1 the series is 
nonstationary and non-mean-reverting. Thus, by letting d take real values, one allows for a 
richer degree of flexibility in the dynamic specification of the series, not achieved when 
using the classical I(0) and I(1) representations. These processes (with non-integer d) were 
introduced by Granger (1980, 1981), Granger and Joyeux (1980) and Hosking (1981) and 
since then have been widely employed to describe the behaviour of many economic and 
financial time series data (see, e.g., Diebold and Rudebusch, 1989; Sowell, 1992; Gil-
Alana and Robinson, 1997).2 
In this paper, we estimate the fractional differencing parameter d using the Whittle 
function in the frequency domain (Dahlhaus, 1989) along with a testing procedure 
developed by Robinson (1994) that allows to test the null hypothesis Ho: d = do in equation 
(2) for any real value do, with xt being the errors in a regression model of the form: 
,...,2,1, =+= txzy ttTt β    (3) 
where yt is the time series we observe, β is a (kx1) vector of unknown coefficients and zt is 
a set of deterministic terms that might include an intercept (i.e., zt = 1), an intercept with a 
linear time trend (zt = (1, t)T), or any other type of deterministic processes. 
 We also apply a method based on a semiparametric local Whittle estimator (see 
Robinson, 1995). The estimator is implicitly defined by:

where do is the true value of d. 
Although there are further refinements of this procedure (e.g., Velasco, 1999, 
Phillips and Shimotsu, 2004, 2005; etc.), these methods require additional user-chosen 
parameters, and therefore the estimation results for d can be very sensitive to the choice of 
these parameters. In this respect, the “local” Whittle method of Robinson (1995), which is 
computationally simpler, appears to be preferable. 
 
3. Data and empirical results 
The series used for the analysis are US Disposable Personal Income (DPI), monthly, 
seasonally adjusted, obtained from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank database, and the 
US House Price Index (HPI), constructed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency 
(http://www.fhfa.gov). For both series the sample starts in 1991m1 and ends in 2010m6. 
[Insert Figures 1 and 2 about here] 
 Figure 1 displays the time series plots of the log-transformed data and of their first 
differences (their growth rates). It can be seen that both log-prices behave in a very similar 
way till April 2007 where HPI starts falling. Instead the corresponding growth rates (in the 
bottom panels of the Figure) exhibit a very different pattern: that of DPI is relatively stable 
over time, whilst that of HPI is quite stable until 1995, then increases till mid-2005 when it 
falls, followed by another sharper fall at the beginning of 2007 coinciding with the start of 
the crisis. Figure 2 displays the correlograms of the four series. The slow decrease in the 
sample autocorrelation values of the log-prices series clearly suggests that they are 
nonstationary. However, the correlograms of the growth rates indicate again a very 
different pattern for the two series: whilst in the case of the growth rate of DPI most of the

macroeconomic time series. 
values are within the 95% confidence interval, in case of HPI the decay is very slow, which 
may be consistent with an I(d) model and d > 0.3 
 Table 1 reports the estimates of d in the following model, 
,...,2,1,)1(; ==−++= tuxLxty ttdtt βα       (5) 
assuming that the error term ut is white noise and autocorrelated in turn. In the latter case, 
we consider first an AR(1) process, and then the exponential spectral model of Bloomfield 
(1973), this being a non-parametric approach that produces autocorrelations decaying 
exponentially as in the AR(MA) case. Finally, we also allow for a seasonal (monthly) 
AR(1) process. Along with the (Whittle) estimates of d we also display the 95% 
confidence band of the non-rejection values of d using Robinson’s (1994) parametric 
approach. 
 Starting with the log of the DPI (in the top panel of Table 1), it can be seen that if 
no regressors are included (i.e., α = β = 0 in (5)), the unit root null hypothesis (i.e., d = 1) 
cannot be rejected for the cases of white noise, Bloomfield and seasonal AR disturbances. 
Moreover, if ut is AR(1) the non-rejection values of d are strictly above 1. On the other 
hand, when assuming more realistically that the process contains an intercept and/or a 
linear trend, the unit root null is rejected in all cases in favour of smaller degrees of 
integration. The estimates of d are between 0.821 and 0.873 in the case of an intercept, and 
between 0.752 and 0.840 with a linear time trend, depending on the type of specification 
adopted for the disturbances. 
[Insert Table 1 about here] 
 The lower panel in Table 1 presents the estimates of d for the log of HPI. When 
deterministic terms are not included the results are very similar to those for the DPI series 
and the I(1) hypothesis cannot be rejected in most of the cases. However, when an 
                                            
3  Also, the significant negative first sample autocorrelation value in the correlogram of the DPI growth rate 
indicates that this series might be now overdifferenced. 
intercept and/or a linear time trend are included, the unit root null is decisively rejected for 
all types of disturbances, the estimated values of d ranging between 1.427 and 1.492 for the 
case of an intercept, and between 1.424 and 1.483 in the presence of a linear trend. 
 The above results indicate very different stochastic properties of the two series: 
whilst DPI exhibits an order of integration strictly below 1 implying mean reversion, the 
order of integration of HPI is strictly above 1, indicating lack of mean reversion and 
implying that the growth rate still displays long memory. These features of the data 
invalidate cointegration analysis between the two series, since in the bivariate case a 
necessary condition for the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship is that the two 
series display the same degree of integration. 
To check the robustness of result that the two series exhibit different orders of 
integration we also apply the semiparametric Whittle method of Robinson (1995). Figure 3 
displays the corresponding results. The bandwidth parameter is reported on the horizontal 
axis, the estimated value of d is shown on the vertical one.4 We also display in the figure 
the 95% confidence intervals corresponding to the I(1) case. The results are consistent with 
those based on the parametric models. Specifically, for the log of DPI (displayed in the top 
panel) the estimates of d are within or below the I(1) interval, depending on the choice of 
the bandwidth parameter m: when this is small most of the estimates are within the 
interval; however, when increasing its value the estimates are strictly below the interval.5 
[Insert Figure 3 about here] 
Focusing now on the log of HPI (in the lower panel of Figure 3), it is evident that 
all the estimates of d are above the I(1) interval for all the bandwith parameters. 
                                            
4 In the case of the Whittle semiparametric estimator of Robinson (1995), the use of optimal values for the 
bandwidth parameter has not been theoretically justified. Some authors, such as Lobato and Savin (1998), 
use an interval of values for m. We have chosen instead to report the results for the whole range of values of 
m. 
5 This clearly shows the trade-off between bias and variance with respect to the choice of the bandwidth 
parameter. 
The final issue examined is parameter stability, in particular whether or not the 
degree of persistence of each series has changed over time. This is important to establish 
whether there were any signs of the impending crisis.6 For this purpose, we estimate again 
the value of d for each series with a sample ending initially at 1999m12. Then, we re-
estimate d adding one observation each time in a recursive manner. First, we conduct the 
analysis with white noise disturbances (see Figure 4), then for the case of seasonal AR 
disturbances (see Figure 5).7 
[Insert Figures 4 and 5 about here] 
Starting with the log of DPI with white noise errors, it is found that the estimated 
value of d remains relatively stable till mid-2008 when it starts increasing. As for the log of 
HPI, the value of d keeps increasing from the beginning of 2000 till the end of 2008, with a 
particularly sharp increase in 2007 and 2008; then it starts decreasing in 2009. Very similar 
results are found in the case of seasonal AR(1) errors (see Figure 5). Note also that after 
mid-2008 the estimated value of d increases for the log of DPI whilst it sharply decreases 
for the log of HPI, which may be a seen as a correction of the disequilibrium between the 
two series once the bubble had burst. Of course, convergence of ths estimates of d for both 
series towards 1 implies that the unit root null will not be rejected and cointegration will be 
found at some future time. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The US subprime mortgage crisis of 2007 and the following worldwide financial crisis 
have led to an even greater degree of interest in housing bubbles, methods to detect them, 
and appropriate policy actions to prevent them or smooth their effects once they have 
occurred. This paper has analysed the relationship between disposable personal income 
                                            
6 For instance, it might be useful to determine if cointegration holds for shorter periods of time before the 
crisis. 
(DPI) and the housing price index (HPI) in the US applying fractional integration and long-
range dependence techniques to monthly data. The empirical findings obtained for the time 
period 1991m1 – 2010m6 indicate that the stochastic properties of the two series are such 
that cointegration cannot hold between them, as mean reversion occurs in the case of DPI 
but not of HPI. This provides useful information for explaining the recent financial crisis 
and choosing appropriate policy actions: the divergence between the two series might be 
related with a bubble in the housing sector, which might have had its origin in the mid- or 
late 90s. Note that the lack of available data before the 90s precludes us from examining 
the possibility of cointegration over a longer time span. However, it does seem that, after 
the bubble had burst, the estimates of d started converging towards one for both series. 
 The implications of the analysis for crisis management and/or prevention are not 
obvious, although visual inspection of the growth rates of the two series (see the bottom 
panels in Figure 1) clearly shows divergence from 1995. Therefore, it might be argued that 
perhaps it would have been desirable to implement active policies to burst the bubble 
already at that time.8 
One interesting extension of this paper would be to examine if similar features can 
also be found in other developed countries. In particular, the degrees of integration of the 
log-DPI and log-HPI series could be analysed to establish whether mean reversion occurs 
or instead the unit root null cannot be rejected. Work along these lines is currently in 
progress.
                                                                                                                                    
7 It would have also been interesting to carry out the analysis for the sub-period 1990-1995. However, the 
number of observations would then be too limited to apply fractional integration techniques. 
8 Note, however, that this is a rather strong conclusion to draw on the basis of univariate tests.
