Preface 
The primary goal of the ILO is to contribute, with member States, to achieve full and 
productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people, a goal 
embedded in the ILO Declaration 2008 on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization, and1 
which has now been widely adopted by the international community. 
In order to support member States and the social partners to reach the goal, the ILO 
pursues a Decent Work Agenda which comprises four interrelated areas: Respect for 
fundamental worker’s rights and international labour standards, employment promotion, 
social protection and social dialogue. Explanations of this integrated approach and related 
challenges are contained in a number of key documents: in those explaining and elaborating 
the concept of decent work2, in the Employment Policy Convention, 1964 (No. 122), and in 
the Global Employment Agenda. 
The Global Employment Agenda was developed by the ILO through tripartite 
consensus of its Governing Body’s Employment and Social Policy Committee. Since its 
adoption in 2003 it has been further articulated and made more operational and today it 
constitutes the basic framework through which the ILO pursues the objective of placing 
employment at the centre of economic and social policies.3 
The Employment Sector is fully engaged in the implementation of the Global 
Employment Agenda, and is doing so through a large range of technical support and 
capacity building activities, advisory services and policy research. As part of its research 
and publications programme, the Employment Sector promotes knowledge-generation 
around key policy issues and topics conforming to the core elements of the Global 
Employment Agenda and the Decent Work Agenda. The Sector’s publications consist of 
books, monographs, working papers, employment reports and policy briefs.4 
The Employment Working Papers series is designed to disseminate the main findings 
of research initiatives undertaken by the various departments and programmes of the 
Sector. The working papers are intended to encourage exchange of ideas and to stimulate 
debate. The views expressed are the responsibility of the author(s) and do not necessarily 
represent those of the ILO.

Foreword 
This paper identifies important trends in the use of ILS in equity markets and 
examines why investors globally are motivated to take up ILS and how they are doing so.  
It also identifies promising initiatives for dialogue between investors, companies, trade 
unions and other actors such as NGOs in hopes of contributing to ongoing efforts to 
improve protection of workers’ rights globally.  
CSR issues are specific to each industry structure. Key factors include: the degree to 
which production is concentrated in relatively few suppliers; the power relationship 
between the brands and the suppliers, which is a function of, inter alia, how easily 
production can be moved between suppliers; and the level of commitment brands are 
willing to make to support suppliers in their efforts to upgrade labour practices. Not least, 
national legal frameworks of countries in which production is concentrated strongly 
influence whether internationally recognized fundamental principles and rights at work are 
realized in practice at the factory level. 
However, there is a common thread throughout all industries: companies need simple, 
effective, yet credible solutions to the challenge of reconciling competitive pressures and 
social concerns, whether as brands or as suppliers. This implies that solutions must benefit 
workers and make good business sense in order to be sustainable. 
Socially responsible investment (SRI) is unique in that its business is to influence the 
social responsibility of other businesses.  Investors, especially institutional ones, can be a 
powerful lever for influencing corporate behaviour, and an important force in helping to 
raise labour standards in corporate practice worldwide.  Although investors have been 
slower to take up labour issues that other areas of SRI, such as environment, interest is 
growing.  Important networks exist for investors to share information, learn from each 
others’ experiences and coordinate strategies to improve outcomes.  More recently, 
strategies are shifting from screening out or divesting to dialogue and remediation to 
support companies to understand the issues and make improvements.  Lastly, some 
financial institutions and trade unions have joined forces to improve the quality of 
information received and further open up the dialogue with companies. 
The ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises 
and Social Policy (MNE Declaration) is designed to guide private initiatives, both 
company policy such as codes of conduct for suppliers, and industry-wide initiatives. It is 
the only international CSR instrument which has the full backing of workers, employers 
and government. This tripartite origin makes it both highly credible and yet sensitive to the 
concerns of enterprises facing tough competition. 
The MNE Declaration covers the fundamental principles and rights at work—
concerning child labour, forced labour, freedom of association, collective bargaining, and 
non-discrimination—as well as wages, hours of work, and occupational health and safety. 
Some of the activities and initiatives taking place in the area of socially responsible 
investment are focused on many of these issues and investors and analysts may find these 
principles to be a useful starting point for dialogue with companies and trade unions on 
how best to protect workers’ rights while helping companies to retain, or even enhance, 
their competitiveness.

1 Introduction 
 
This paper examines why investors globally are motivated to take up issues 
concerning international labour standards (ILS), and how they are doing so. 
Investors, especially institutional ones, can be a powerful lever for influencing 
corporate behaviour, and an important force in helping to raise labour standards in 
corporate practice worldwide.  However, this potential remains underdeveloped. 
Investors’ knowledge of ILS remains superficial in many cases. At times they have 
used their leverage to push for policies and codes to improve labour standards in the 
operations of corporations whose shares they own. However, in most cases they have not 
been successful at addressing the larger situation in which the root causes of persistent 
labour violations are embedded, although some have made efforts in this direction. 
Institutional investors also have not yet built strong alliances with like-minded parties 
(such as trade unions) who could boost their leverage on ILS. In addition, the incorporation 
of ILS into investment faces obstacles that the incorporation of other non-financial factors 
(environmental, social and governance, or “ESG”) does not. 
This paper examines a number of these elements.  The first section outlines the rise of 
Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) in general and labour-related SRI in particular. It 
touches on some of the main forces and actors behind this rise, and highlights various SRI 
practices of institutional investors, with reference to earlier research commissioned by the 
ILO, as well as newer research. 
The second section examines specific challenges facing labour-related SRI, and 
explores why the incorporation of ILS into investment criteria might pose more challenges 
than do other ESG factors. Sections III and IV look briefly at the impact of SRI on 
corporate behaviour and workers’ rights, respectively. Section V looks at some suggested 
ways forward. Appendix I presents select mechanisms, initiatives and platforms that could 
support the spread of labour-related SRI, and Appendix II provides a closer look at an 
institutional investor that has specific guidelines around the labour rights performance of 
companies in which it invests. 
This paper seeks to illuminate some of the important trends in the use of ILS in equity 
markets, to point up gaps not only in the research but in the actions of investors and others, 
and to highlight promising initiatives in this area.  In this way, it is hoped that the paper will 
contribute to ongoing efforts to raise labour standards globally.

2 The expansion of SRI  
SRI is the practice of incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
factors into one’s investment decisions.  Social investors are concerned with a corporation’s 
social and environmental impact, not simply its financial performance. SRI uses three key 
strategies: screening companies according to ESG criteria; shareholder advocacy; and 
community investing.5  
Labour standards have long been an important issue for social investors. Along with 
environment and corporate governance, labour rights in global supply chains figure 
perennially among the top three or four issues of concern to social investors. Most SRI 
funds and ratings agencies include performance on international labour standards (ILS) 
among the key issue areas on which they evaluate company performance on environmental, 
social and governance factors (ESG) overall.  
Looking generally at SRI, the picture has been one of steady growth in recent years.  
According to the US Social Investment Forum (SIF) 2007 Report on Socially Responsible 
Investing Trends in the United States, between 2005 and 2007, SRI assets increased about 
18% while all managed assets in the U.S. grew less than 3% over the same period.6  
According to another source, SRI fund assets have grown over 12% per year on average 
from 1997 to 2007.7 A commonly cited figure is that in the U.S. today about $1 in $9 under 
management is in SRI assets.  As of 2007 there were approximately 100 SRI mutual funds 
in the U.S.8

1995 $639 billion 
2003 $2.16 trillion 
2005 $2.29 trillion 
2007 $2.7 trillion 
 
According to a report in 2008 by the European Social Investment Forum (Eurosif), as 
of the end of 2007, total SRI assets under management in Europe amounted to 2.67 trillion

Euros.10 In 2005, social investment research firm Avanzi reported that there were 375 
“green, social and ethical funds operating in Europe”, a rise of about 6% from the previous 
year.11  While the UK accounts for a good portion of European SRI funds (about one-third, 
according to Avanzi), growth has been brisk in other countries. In France, institutional SRI 
almost doubled from 2005 to 2006, from 5.4 billion to 10.5 billion Euros. Novethic, a 
subsidiary of Caisse des Depots that conducts research and analysis of SRI and corporate 
social responsibility (CSR), notes that large pension funds have pushed this trend.12  EIRIS, 
a UK-based SRI research firm, reports that, as of September 2007, the global total of funds 
that integrate ESG into their analysis was about US$4 trillion.13  
One source concludes that retail investors in the U.S. are driving SRI growth in that 
country, while institutional investors are behind the growth in Europe.14  The U.S. is 
generally seen as lagging behind Europe in ethical investment; both the EU and individual 
European governments have shown support for SRI (and CSR). However, certain US 
public pension funds have long been involved in SRI, and others are becoming more so: 
one example is their engagement with the Sudan divestment movement, as noted briefly 
below (legislation in several states has mandated public pension funds to divest from 
Sudan).   
2.1 Factors behind the growth of SRI 
There are several factors behind the growth of SRI:  
• Changes in the concept of fiduciary duty: in 2005, the law firm Freshfields 
Bruckhaus Deringer published a report that concluded that the incorporation 
of ESG factors into investment decision-making was “clearly permissible and 
is arguably required in all jurisdictions”.15 Many considered the report ground-
breaking on the issue of ESG incorporation, and it has been widely cited, 
including within mainstream finance.  
• Demonstration effect: a number of large institutional investors are very 
publicly bringing SRI into their investing.  In 2007, TIAA-CREF, one of the 
world’s largest pension funds, published a “Policy Statement on Corporate 
Governance” and proxy voting guidelines that clearly “put social and 
environmental issues on par with corporate governance issues”.16 The policy 
statement was expected to send a message to other institutional investors, as

well as to companies, about the importance of environmental and social 
considerations. The statement noted that, among other issues, boards should 
“pay careful attention to…[a] company’s labour and human rights policies and 
practices and their applicability through the supply and distribution chains”.17  
• Legislative changes and national and regional debate that have raised 
awareness of certain environmental and social issues among investors.  A 
number of authors have pointed out that a crucial driver of the growth of SRI 
in the United Kingdom was legislation in 2000 that required pension funds to 
disclose the extent to which they incorporated ESG criteria.18 And there is 
ongoing debate in the UK around public company non-financial reporting, 
including on supply chains19. In March 2007, the European Parliament voted 
in favour of mandatory reporting on corporate environmental and social 
impacts.20 Tougher regulations on environment (e.g. greenhouse gas 
emissions) have led to shareholder concerns about corporations’ 
environmental impact and their environmental management systems and, in 
2007, US shareholders asked the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
to require companies to disclose risks related to climate change. 
• Corporate scandals, beginning in the early 2000s, have helped push investors 
toward SRI and shareholder activism, and have raised awareness of corporate 
governance issues in particular.21 
• In December 2006, the heads of the six largest accounting firms in the world 
released a statement calling for “social auditing”, or a “radical overhaul” of 
global financial accounting “to take greater account of social and 
environmental factors”, a development that Ethical Performance called 
“unprecedented”.22 
• Mainstream investment houses are turning their attention to the 
incorporation of ESG factors. Some have published reports showing that 
investors who incorporate ESG into their decision-making do not necessarily 
have lower investment returns (see below, on mainstream interest in ESG).

MacKenzie, eds., Responsible Investment, Greenleaf Publishing, 2006, p. 151.  
19 The UK government decided in late 2005 not to make mandatory the so-called Operating and Financial 
Reviews, which would have required companies to report on environmental and social factors.  But in late 2006 
the government did pass an amendment to the Company Law Reform Bill that requires public companies to 
report on their supply chains. This was welcomed by rights groups but was opposed by industry groups. See for 
example Jean Eaglesham, “Government Cracks Down on Corporate Accountability”, Financial Times, October 
19, 2006.

• In 2006, the UN launched its Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI): 
this voluntary initiative has as its stated aim to “help investors integrate 
consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into 
investment decision-making and ownership practices”. At its launch, there 
were 65 signatories, many of them institutional investors. As of late 2008, 
there were over 400 signatories, among them asset owners, investment 
managers, and service providers. 
Each of these developments has increased the impetus on investors to consider ESG 
factors in investment decisions.  
Social investors have evolved in their methods and strategies over the years. Whereas 
SRI through the 1990s was associated primarily with negative screening, in recent years 
social investors have used positive screening - seeking out companies with good 
performance on ESG factors – and have increasingly turned to engagement of companies 
on issues of concern. Divestment, which was a key SRI strategy in relation to companies 
invested in South Africa during apartheid, remains an option, usually of last resort, for SRI. 
The Sudan divestment movement, in which social investors are active, has moved to 
“targeted divestment” precisely because it is thought to be more effective than blanket 
divestment and less likely to harm Sudanese citizens.23 
2.1.1  Mainstream interest in ESG: A mixed 
blessing?  
The last five years have seen the publication of numerous, high-profile reports by 
mainstream investment banks, brokerage houses, law firms and the UN, on the importance 
of incorporating ESG into investment. While the trend has arguably contributed to the 
growth of SRI, it also brings challenges such as potential dilution of standards.  
These reports have included:  
• “The Materiality of Social, Environmental, and Corporate Governance Issues 
to Equity Pricing” (June 2004). The report, commissioned by UNEP-FI, 
summarized the findings of 11 studies by brokerage house analysts, concluded 
that ESG factors should be considered in investment decision-making.  It also 
called on governments and regulatory bodies to revise definitions of fiduciary 
duty to include consideration of ESG factors.24   
• The lawfirm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer released a report in 2005, 
commissioned by UNEP-FI, stating that fiduciary duty allows, and sometimes 
requires, incorporation of ESG issues.25  
• The investment bank Goldman Sachs’ “GS Sustain” (July 2007) concluded 
that companies that incorporate ESG policies outperformed the MSCI 
(Morgan Stanley Capital International) index by 25% between August 2005 
and mid-2007. Goldman Sachs noted that “there is no evidence that ESG or

SRI investing on their own add value”, and investors therefore need to 
incorporate ESG “into a long-term industrial analysis”.26 
UNEP-FI and Mercer, the investment consulting company, published a joint report, 
“Demystifying Responsible Investment Performance: A Review of Key Academic and 
Broker Research on ESG Factors” (October 2007). The report reviewed 20 academic 
studies examining the relationship between ESG incorporation and financial performance.  
As with previous studies, the short timeframe of some of the research involved makes 
it difficult to formulate definitive conclusions about those data.27 However, the report’s 
coordinators concluded that “the evidence suggests that there at least does not appear to be 
a performance penalty”.28   
There are downsides to this mainstream interest:   
• A disjuncture between “saying” and “doing”: the fact that CEO interest in 
CSR is increasing, and that corporations have “embraced the idea that 
[business] plays a wider role in society”29 contrasts sharply with the failure of 
companies actually to implement CSR. The McKinsey Quarterly surveys of 
business executives in 2005 and 2007 found large gaps between what 
companies say they should do (for example, integrate ESG factors into their 
operations) and what they actually do.30 A case in point: even large, 
mainstream firms that have focused their attention, in a high-profile manner, 
on the possible connection between ESG and financial performance are not 
necessarily committed in practice.  In October 2007, a campaign group in the 
UK, FairPensions, scored large asset managers on their transparency and 
engagement on ESG criteria at the companies in which they invest. Goldman 
Sachs tied for last place on both counts.31 
• Ethics still loses out to return on investment: even where mainstream 
financial analysts seek to move closer to SRI analysis, financial returns are 
still prioritised over all else. For example, Citigroup Smith Barney’s 2005 
report, Crossing the River, which was an effort to bridge SRI and the 
mainstream, suggests SRI investors will “prioritize shareholder interests” over 
 
 
26 Goldman Sachs, “GS Sustain”, June 22 2007, p. 1, emphasis added. Interestingly, GS found that with regard 
to employee compensation, “the more you pay, the more you get. This raises questions about the theory of cost-
control and downsizing as the key to success” (Ibid, p. 7). Coming from a mainstream investment bank, this 
conclusion should spark useful debates in the global marketplace.

all else.32  There is thus a danger of the mainstream diluting SRI instead of 
SRI influencing the mainstream to make fundamental changes in analysis and 
investment.  
• Timeframe: investor mentality is still dominated by short-termism, which 
works against the incorporation of ESG.33  
• ILS: the mainstream incorporation of ILS faces its own challenges (as 
detailed in Section II). As a McKinsey analysis pointed out in 2007, “there are 
still significant free-rider problems and a risk for those companies that wish to 
deploy higher ‘international norms’ (for example, with respect to child labour) 
that they will lose out to less scrupulous competitors. There are still strong 
‘race to the bottom’ pressures”.34 
Indeed, the biggest performance gap McKinsey & Co. found between what companies 
say they should do and what they actually do (32%) was in the area of global supply chain 
management.35 
Given these downsides, it is interesting to note the appearance of a study like Pictet’s 
Less Can Be More…A New Approach to SRI Research, in March 2005, both because it 
came from a private Swiss bank (albeit one with an interest in sustainable investing), and 
because it posits an indicator of particular relevance to the ILO – job generation – as the 
key social indicator for measuring CSR.36 Whether this argument holds up is another 
question, and one seasoned observer of SRI has criticized the study’s “radical 
reductionism” as going against the “diversity of SRI”.37  
Still, the idea is a provocative one, and in 2006 Pictet followed up with a report that 
argued against choosing only indicators that have a “material impact” on corporate 
financial performance, and for “criteria that are desirable from a purely sustainable point of 
view”.38 Views like these are worthy of the attention of both SRI and mainstream investors.

2.1.2 Expansion of SRI in Developing Countries 
Overview 
Investor interest in developing countries or “emerging markets” (EM) continues to 
grow, and investors who specifically seek SRI opportunities globally are among those 
turning their attention to these markets. An important driver, as described by Garcia, is the 
“growing aging population” in developed countries: “to prevent the anticipated stress on 
payouts by public pension funds, these institutional investors are thinking of creative and 
riskier ways of increasing their assets by expanding their international portfolios”.39 
According to one source, investment in developing countries expanded greatly in 
2006.40 Another source reported that, although the World Bank’s International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) has calculated that “only 0.1% of SRI funds worldwide are invested in 
emerging market assets”, SRI in emerging markets is expanding.41 
This interest, as well as the realization that there has been little reliable research on 
developing country corporate performance on environmental, social and governance 
factors, has provided some of the motivation behind a small but growing number of SRI 
funds and indexes geared toward investment in developing countries.   
There are various strands of SRI in relation to emerging markets. One consists of 
western funds and indexes based on those countries, of which there is a number. For 
example, in 2000, the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS), one of 
the largest pension funds in the world, began screening the emerging market countries in 
which it invested, according to labour practices (including adherence to ILO conventions), 
political stability, financial transparency, and other governance factors.42 There are also 
funds and indexes based in those countries, which are an interesting recent development. 
This section touches on a few of these, and the context in which they have arisen.  
The first SRI funds based in an emerging market country were the Fundos Ethical, 
launched in Brazil in 2001 by ABN-Amro Brazil.43 Since those early days, a number of 
recent developments indicate SRI is destined to grow significantly in developing countries, 
and several studies over the past five years have outlined key elements necessary for this 
growth.

International Labour Standards” August 2007, (research conducted for the ILO), p. 6.

2006 than in any previous year, increasing 21% to the former and 68% to the latter: UNCTAD, “World 
Investment Report 2007”, Switzerland, 2007, p. xv.

and Rexiter Capital, and research from Innovest Strategic Value Advisors. See Environmental Finance News

In 2003, the IFC published a report, “Towards Sustainable and Responsible 
Investment in Emerging Markets”. It concluded there would not likely be “rapid, ‘organic’ 
growth of SRI in emerging markets over the short term”, but that “in the medium and long 
term…growth prospects appear solid, particularly among institutional investors (both in 
developed countries and emerging markets), fuelled by promising SRI fund performance, 
improving regulatory standards, growing demand for SRI, and increasing acceptance by 
institutional investors of SRI as a financially worthy and even desirable approach”.44    
The same year, the Association for Sustainable and Responsible Investment in Asia 
(AsRIA) published, with IFC support, a report entitled “SRI in Asian Emerging Markets”. 
The report’s project manager observed that “the introduction of SRI into Asian markets will 
cause new forms of SRI to emerge, widening and broadening the debate on what values, 
screens and approaches are most effective in each market”.45 
The report, which focused on seven Asian countries, concluded that there was “plenty 
of evidence that would support the successful introduction of SRI” in all seven. This was 
due to a number of developments throughout these countries, including “gradually 
improving corporate transparency”, increasing environmental and social awareness in the 
general population as well as among investors in these countries, “encouragement by 
regulatory authorities for adoption of higher standards of corporate governance”, and an 
opening up to foreign investment.46  
The report cautioned that “the introduction of superficial SRI funds may mobilize 
investment interest in the short term but harm long-term support for SRI”.47 
In 2006, AsRIA published another IFC-supported report entitled, “Taking Stock – 
Adding Sustainability Variables to Asian Sectoral Analysis”. The report focused on eight 
high-impact sectors (including banks, metals and mining, supply chain companies, and 
energy), and was aimed in part at “Asian investors, companies and policymakers”.48 Its goal 
was to address a research gap in Asia: that of the lack of evaluation of ESG-related risks 
and opportunities in relation to Asian listed companies. AsRIA found that environmental 
issues “dominate” but that there was a lack of incentives to address these.  It noted that 
“rising incomes and expectations across Asia” would likely bring tighter regulations and 
enforcement, something already being seen in some parts of Asia.49 
Looking more broadly at developing countries over the past five years, we see the 
beginnings of SRI expansion in several countries, with interesting developments in both the 
public and private sectors. Both South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) and 
Brazil’s Bovespa launched SRI indexes (see Box 1 below), South Africa in 2004 and Brazil 
in 2005. South Africa’s was the first SRI index in a developing country market, and

Brazil’s was the first SRI index in Latin America.  In 2006, the first SRI index in Malaysia 
was launched.50 The following year, the Malaysian government began to require public 
companies to publish CSR information.51 Also in 2007, ABN-Amro launched the first SRI 
fund in India,52 followed in early 2008 by a pilot SRI index in India (See Box 2 – 
KLD/S&P index). 
Most recently, a study in late 2008 by social investors in the United States called 
attention to the “move towards increased reporting standards by regulatory bodies and stock 
exchanges” in several countries. Among the countries discussed are the above-mentioned 
examples from Malaysia, Brazil and South Africa, and the study notes that these 
developments have been “largely driven by governmental goals to increase investment and 
keep markets competitive.”53 
 
 
50 The OWW ResponsibilityTM Malaysia SRI Index was launched in 2006 by OWW Consulting, a business 
consultancy based in Malaysia and Singapore that specializes in CSR and SRI research. The motivation behind 
the index was to provide international social investors with information on the ESG performance of Malaysian 
and Singaporean companies to give them increased investment opportunities abroad; to raise awareness among 
Malaysian companies about CSR and SRI; and to bring more social investment into Malaysia and Singapore 
from regional investors. See AsRIA, “The First Socially Responsible Investment (SRI) Index for Malaysia”,

Examples from South Africa and Brazil 
South Africa 
 
In South Africa, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange SRI Index (JSE SRI) was launched in May 2004 in 
response to a “burgeoning debate around sustainability globally and particularly in the South African context”.54 
It was the first SRI index in an emerging market country, and the first SRI index launched by a stock exchange. 
It ranks companies according to ESG and economic factors.  
There were several drivers.  The Second King Report on Corporate Governance emphasized the so-
called TBL or “triple bottom line” (environmental, social, financial), but companies “needed guidance” on TBL 
practices. Investors wanted to invest in companies with good ESG performance, and this index is meant to offer 
criteria for evaluating this performance, as well as an “aspirational sustainability benchmark”.55   
Interestingly, Ethical Corporation noted in 2004 that the maintenance of the JSE SRI index was not 
contracted out, as many developed country indexes are. The index puts an emphasis on issues of particular 
concern in South Africa, such as Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and HIV/AIDS.56  As such, the index 
demonstrates the potential importance of “homegrown,” as opposed to imported, indexes in developing 
countries.  However, in late 2007, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange announced that it was partnering with 
UK-based SRI research firm Ethical Investment Research Services (EIRIS).  As of 2007 the JSE SRI index 
based its environmental criteria on those of FTSE4Good, and its indicators were aligned with the UN Principles 
for Responsible Investment.57 Tozer reported in 2006 that South Africa had 21 SRI funds, with a total of USD 
1.6bn assets under management.58 The JSE SRI index does not impose any exclusions (that is, it does not 
exclude any industries or sectors). The index has come in for criticism, with one observer arguing, for example, 
that it is “not well monitored”.59 
Further, in 2007 UNEP-FI and a number of partners released a study, The State of Responsible 
Investment in South Africa, based on a survey of pension fund officers, asset manager officers, and investment 
advisory service providers in the South African investment community. Among the findings: about 70% said 
most ESG issues were “at least somewhat material in ‘evaluating the likely performance of investments’”. 
However, most also said they were “either doing nothing about this or had a limited proportion of assets in 
responsible investment portfolios”. The report called, in response, for a “very simple business case” to be made 
clearly that “a broad range of ESG issues are material” to performance evaluation. Most respondents also 
called for “more stringent legislation” to drive responsible investment, but not surprisingly, “almost no-one really 
liked the idea”. 60

Brazil 
 
In Brazil, the Bovespa Corporate Sustainability Index (Indice de Sustentabilidade Empresarial, ISE) was 
launched in December 2005. It had financing from the IFC and was developed by the Center for Sustainability 
Studies at the Fundacao Getulio Vargas. In early 2001 Brazil’s Unibanco had started conducting ESG research 
on Bovespa companies, “exclusively” for non-Brazilian SRI funds.  Later that year Banco Real ABN Amro 
launched the first two emerging market SRI funds in the world.   
In 2004 Banco Itau launched the Itau Social Excellence Fund; Bovespa also created the New Market 
(Novo Mercado) and launched the Corporate Governance Stock Market Index, tracking companies with good 
corporate governance performance. Bovespa was the first stock exchange to join the Global Compact.  
Membership in the Global Compact, as well as the “lack of a benchmark for SRI funds,” were two 
motivating factors behind Bovespa’s launch of the ISE. A working group was created to develop an index 
methodology. The group proposed the methodology to the IFC, which funded the initiative.  Bovespa joined the 
Center for Sustainability Studies/Fundacao Getulio Vargas and created the index (the advisory board included 
IBASE, Instituto Ethos, and the Environment Ministry, among others). The Center studied the GRI, the Dow 
Jones Sustainability Index, FTSE4Good, and the JSE-SRI, among other sources.61   
The Center then sent out questionnaires to companies and conducted a public consultation around the 
questionnaire, both with specialists and the general public. According to Bovespa, the resulting questionnaire is 
an extensive one that is continuously improved.62  
One press account of the launch of Bovespa ISE noted that ISE had the Brazilian Association of Pension 
Funds (known as ABRAPP) on its board, a sign of local institutional investor interest in SRI63 (the entity, 
ABRAPP, is still on the board). At the time of its launch, only 10 Brazilian companies met GRI reporting 
requirements, and the article noted that “battling the lack of transparency in Brazil’s private sector, much of 
which remains family-owned, requires a cultural shift”.64 
The Bovespa ISE does not exclude any sectors, using positive screening instead.  However, companies 
in high-impact sectors have their “management” and “performance” scores weighted more heavily than their 
“policies”. The index is based on analysis of triple bottom line factors (environmental, social, financial) plus 
corporate governance, and has a maximum of 40 companies.  Its stated goal is to create a “Brazilian 
benchmark” for both Brazilian and international social investors. 
 
 
2.1.3  Future prospects for SRI in developing 
countries 
Commentary on the SRI market in developing countries or regions has underscored 
the fact that families often control large companies (in Asia, India and Brazil, for 
example65). This presents a potential barrier, at least in the immediate future, to 
transparency and independence, both of which are valued by social investors. Further, the

AsRIA report of 2006 pointed out that the prevalence in Asia of state-owned enterprises 
could also constitute a barrier to SRI, in part because of the limits to shareholder power.66 
Indeed, in a 2006 report for EIRIS entitled “Broadening Horizons for Responsible 
Investment: An Analysis of 50 Major Emerging Markets Companies”, Tozer notes that 
factors holding back SRI investment in emerging markets include:  
• lack of disclosure on corporate activities and performance; 
• fund managers’ tendency to underestimate differences across emerging 
market countries, both in terms of corporate structure and governance and 
in terms of “key drivers and attitudes” toward CSR and investment; 
• lack of third-party research organizations based in developing countries that 
can conduct research on corporate ESG performance.67   
Tozer hits on an important issue regarding the expansion of SRI into developing 
countries: that the phenomenon of western investors exporting a model is not only likely to 
breed resentment; it also fails to prepare the ground for a homegrown model of responsible 
investment in these countries, which is the only way it is likely to take root successfully. 
Certain tenets of SRI can and should be translated globally, such as demanding respect for 
universal labour standards from all corporations. But that does not take away from the fact 
that the spread of SRI in developing countries is complex and does not lend itself to 
blueprints. 
Tozer concludes that “the overwhelming majority of companies in the study have 
shown evidence of addressing at least some environmental, social and governance issues in 
their public disclosures, with some significantly so”.68 South African companies are 
“notably ahead of other emerging markets” on CSR disclosure, and some countries’ 
companies do well on one measure while doing poorly on others (e.g. some Taiwanese 
companies perform well on environment but poorly on governance). Some of the emerging 
market companies studied “compare favorably” on some measures with their counterparts 
in developed markets.69  It is worth noting that, in late 2008, the IFC and GRI launched a 
joint initiative to build the capacity of emerging markets companies to report according to 
GRI standards.70 
A number of observers have underscored the question that the EIRIS report itself has 
raised: whether companies in developing countries should be judged by the same standards 
as in developed countries. Tozer has said that the relevant point was not that investors had

to lower their standards to invest in developing country companies, but rather that they 
should engage companies “to try and get them to raise their standards.”71 Such a position is 
consistent with a shift in SRI as practiced in some developed countries as well, away from 
exclusion and toward engagement. This works where shareholder rights are strong, but may 
be less realistic where such rights are weak, a point AsRIA has made in its research on 
emerging markets.  
Further, it is not so much a question of developing markets looking toward the west, 
but rather a two-way street; western markets should also be looking with interest toward 
developing country markets such as South Africa and Brazil, and monitoring what happens, 
for example, when stock exchanges incorporate ESG into their listing standards.  
 Box 2 
India’s Pilot SRI Index 
In early 2008, a consortium made up of Indian economic research firm CRISIL Ltd. (Standard & Poor’s 
India affiliate), investment research and index firm Standard & Poor’s, and social investment research firm KLD 
Research & Analytics, Inc.72 launched a pilot SRI index in India. The index had its origins in an international 
competition to encourage better ESG research in emerging market countries: in 2006, the IFC had awarded a 
grant to the consortium to develop a pilot SRI index of Indian companies based on ESG performance.  The 
index is envisioned as a potential model for other emerging markets. 
 
2.2 Labour-related SRI 
With regard to labour-related SRI in particular, there are multiple factors driving its 
growth, though there seems to be little research in this area. The section below on 
Institutional Investors and SRI looks at some proxies for this growth, such as the number of 
labour-related shareholder resolutions filed in recent years, and provides preliminary 
commentary.     
Some of the factors driving labour-related SRI include:  
• exposes throughout the 1990s on ILS violations in the global supply chains 
of many well-known public companies, such as Wal-Mart, Nike, Disney 
and Gap. These exposés have been based in large part on the early and 
continued work of labour rights groups and unions to reveal what goes 
on in those supply chains73  
• domestic politics: controversy, particularly in the U.S., over companies 
increasingly moving production overseas, bringing further attention to the

move to low-wage countries and the labour conditions that prevail there 
(as well as criticism about the resulting loss of domestic jobs) 
• increased availability of information on what is going on in overseas 
supply chains, which has driven not only consumer anger but investor 
demand for companies to address ILS in their supply chains 
• continued and more sophisticated investor demand, often through 
shareholder resolutions on ILS, but also through increasingly pointed 
questions to companies, which has helped keep the issue on the front 
burner (see section III). 
• For example, in the UK, Adam Ognall of the UK Social Investment Forum 
(UKSIF) has noted the increasing interest investors have in knowing what 
is affecting company performance in the area of supply chain management, 
and what reputational risk around supply chain management means in 
financial terms. Ognall has pointed out that audits of factories and other 
data that companies report on supply chain management do not address 
this need or interest. UK investors are increasingly looking at supply chain 
management and performance in terms of materiality.74  
• the “demonstration effect” of well-known players in the investment world 
focusing specifically on labour standards and the workplace. For example:  
• U.S.-based Parnassus Investments launched its Workplace Fund in April 
2005, which seeks to invest in companies that are considered exceptional 
places to work75  
• In 2004, FTSE4Good, in collabouration with the ILO, began incorporating 
labour standards criteria in its index, and now makes yearly 
announcements on companies that have been removed from the index due 
to failure to comply with these standards 
2.2.1 Key actors in the rise of labour-related SRI   
Key actors have also influenced the take-up of labour-related SRI, including the 
following: 
• Labour rights and human rights groups broke the story in the 1990s of 
violations of international labour standards (ILS) in the supply chains 
and/or owned operations of foreign companies. Social investors rely on the 
research and reports of these groups, not only for raw data for use in 
evaluating individual companies, but also as barometers of trends in how 
corporations treat ILS in their operations 76. The SRI community is also

For”, to choose the fund’s constituents. See  http://www.parnassus.com/parnassus-mutual-
funds/workplace/default.aspx  
76 A good example of an NGO report on ILS that social investors found particularly helpful was Oxfam 
International’s “Trading Away Our Rights” (2004), which was a critical look at labour conditions in overseas 
 
 
  16
increasingly working with labour rights and human rights organizations in 
the global north and south to address ILS in global supply chains.77  
• Social investors – in particular, so-called “pure-play” SRI funds such as 
Trillium Asset Management and Domini Social Investments in the U.S., 
and Sustainable Asset Management in Europe – have helped drive the 
incorporation of labour standards in investment decisions by pushing the 
issue with companies.   
• SRI research and ratings agencies, such as KLD Research & Analytics, 
Innovest, EIRIS, and CentreInfo provide investors with essential 
information on corporate performance. Companies in turn are increasingly 
turning to SRI research and ratings agencies to know what SRI is 
interested in.

managers. Vigeo bases its ratings criteria on ILO conventions, among other things

Mainstream asset managers are becoming more important plyers in SRI. In addition, 
certain fund managers, particularly in the UK, have “developed an SRI strategy for their 
mainstream funds”.78 As Peter Frankental of Amnesty International notes, SRI fund 
managers have been “a good conduit of issues between pressure groups and business; they 
have better access to companies than NGOs, they can speak the language of business and 
can frame issues in a way that is more likely to evoke a positive response”79 (however, see 
the end of Section III for Frankental’s own reality check on this issue). In some cases, asset 
managers have been more active on ESG incorporation than asset owners have been.80 
• Certain activist public pension funds are particularly important 
because they have taken public stances on ESG incorporation, because 
they manage such large sums of money (and often hold enough shares 
 
 
farms and factories that supply western companies. The report expressly called on institutional investors, among 
others, to promote protection of ILS in international supply chains.  
77 It is worth underscoring the role of coalitions of these groups, or dedicated campaigns around the protection 
and promotion of ILS in global supply chains. In specific instances, these campaigns have brought cases of 
mistreatment of factory workers into the international spotlight and have brought pressure to bear on 
international retailers or brands buying from those factories. See Florence Palpacuer, “New Forms of Social 
Dialogues in Transnational Production Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Activist Campaigns in the Global 
Apparel Industry”, presentation at UNRISD conference on “Business, Social Policy and Corporate Political 
Influence in Developing Countries”, Geneva, November 12-13, 2007.

in individual companies to get their attention), and because other 
institutional investors look to them as models. Some of these (e.g. 
CalPERs and the Norwegian Pension Fund Global) have been activist 
on ILS issues in particular.81 Initiatives such as the UN Principles for 
Responsible Investment have targeted these players. As of late 2007, 76 
signatories to the initiative were public or union pension funds.82 These 
funds are not always moving forward steadily on the incorporation of 
ESG. For example, according to a 2007 survey of 278 pension funds of 
companies in the FTSE4Good UK index, over half declined to 
participate in a study of responsible investment practices, and only a 
small percentage (12%) provided “usable information” to the survey.83 
However, pension funds remain a key player in the growth of both SRI 
in general and labour-related SRI in particular, and their potential to 
drive further growth is enormous. 
• Major public pension funds have identified international inter-
governmental organizations, such as the OECD (Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development) and the ILO, as well as the 
UN Global Compact, as having “helped shape the basis of the 
international principles” that they, as investors, have adopted.84 
• The Principles for Responsible Investment, spearheaded by UNEP-FI 
and the Global Compact is expected to further drive the incorporation 
of ESG into investment. While the PRI does not focus on SRI per se 
but on mainstreaming ESG into investment and on “active ownership,” 
it tries to encourage signatories to address issues that are relevant to 
their portfolios85, which may include ILS. UNEP-FI has also had an 
essential role in advancing research – including by mainstream players 
– on the link between ESG and financial performance (see above, on 
mainstream interest in ESG).  
• Certain companies have begun to work with groups with which they 
had only a confrontational relationship in the past, in an effort to 
address concerns about ongoing labour rights violations in their 
international operations. For example, Gap, Inc. is working with the 
International Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation 
(ITGLWF) to bring labour unions into the assessment of supply chain

Pension Fund’s Council on Ethics, in addition to researching information in the public domain, also makes field 
visits in some cases  “to verify the quality of commissioned work” and “to obtain first-hand knowledge on 
specific company cases” (including cases of child labour and other labour violations in developing countries:

What Social Investors Do In Relation to ILS 
Screening and shareholder resolutions give a rather two-dimensional view of SRI work. In addition to 
resolutions, research and dialogues, some of the things social investors and SRI researchers do in relation to 
ILS include:  
 Direct involvement with companies working on supply chain management. 
 Ex. Social investors visit factories supplying companies in which they invest. 
 Participation in workshops and multi-stakeholder initiatives with companies, unions and NGOs 
on issues well beyond codes of conduct and policies. 
 Ex. EICC, Business for Social Responsibility’s Beyond Monitoring. 
 Providing both public and private feedback to companies on draft CSR reports. 
 Networking with others in the SRI and NGO communities to increase leverage.  
 Brokering discussions between companies and other stakeholders. 
 Lobbying government agencies and elected officials directly through letters and meetings 
(social investors work with civil society organizations to put out public statements on issues of 
mutual concern, and they enter into direct dialogue with government agencies and elected 
officials on these issues).86 
 Ex. SEC in the U.S., regulatory agencies in Europe. 
 Meeting with affected parties. 
 Ex. Factory workers alleging ILS violations in the supply chains of investee companies. 
 
 
2.2.2 The role of trade unions  
Trade unions have been important actors – and could expand their role – in the growth 
of SRI. They have the potential to influence corporate behaviour through workers’ capital; 
the money invested in funds to cover workers’ retirement represents an important force, as 
workers are “indirect owners” of equity shares through pension funds.87 
A 2002 source estimated total workers’ capital globally at over $5 trillion.88 Another 
source cited an estimate in 2003 of US$11 trillion.89

Capital”, November 2002, pg. v.  
  19
According to one set of data, the so-called Taft-Hartley funds, or union-managed 
pension funds in the U.S., owned a total of $438 billion.90 This amount is relatively small 
when compared to corporate or government pension funds.91 But public pension funds often 
cover substantial numbers of unionised state employees, who frequently have 
representation among pension board trustees.92   
In 1999 the Committee on Workers Capital (CWC) was created to coordinate activity 
on areas such as shareholder activism and educating pension fund trustees.93 And since 
1997 the US union confederation AFL-CIO has had a Capital Stewardship Program; in 
1998 it began a review process through which it has regularly reviewed “worker-friendly 
investment products” in several asset classes.94 
In addition, unions have worked with social investors to address individual cases of 
concern about corporate behaviour, including through dialogue or exchange of 
information with faith-based investor groups and SRI rating agencies.  
• Union pension funds also file shareholder resolutions, sometimes 
jointly with other investors. According to one source, as of 2007 in the 
U.S., “after faith-based investors, more labour unions and union 
affiliates…are filing social issues resolutions than any other segment of 
institutional investors”95 (see section III, Box 5 for an interesting 
example of a joint resolution). 
• Individual unions (for example, the Service Employees International 
Union, SEIU) have done substantial work to educate pension fund 
trustees on issues of concern to organized labour. Unions are also 
beginning the work of getting pension funds to adopt the UN PRI. 96  
• In the UK, although union-led shareholder activism is not as well-
developed as in the U.S., trade unions are poised to influence pension 
funds on company behaviour, in part because of favourable legislation 
as well as union initiatives. As Tom Powdrill, formerly with the UK 
Trades Union Congress (TUC) has noted: (1) by law, one-third of

pension fund trustees must be member-nominated, and many member-
nominated trustees (MNTs) are members of unions. This will rise to 
one-half in the near future; (2) the TUC has created a network (TUC 
Member Trustee Network), through which it works to encourage 
shareholder activism by trustees; and (3) TUC itself conducts 
shareholder voting campaigns each year, including on labour-related 
issues.97 
• Powdrill acknowledges that one challenge for unions on shareholder 
activism is “whether trade unions can legitimately raise questions as 
investors without compromising their fiduciary duty as trustees”. He 
also recognizes that unions were “perhaps slow to respond to the 
opportunities presented by responsible investment”. But he notes that 
this is beginning to change.98 
• The European liaison of the US-based SEIU, Michael Laslett, who 
works with investors and asset managers in Europe, reports that unions 
in the U.S. and Europe are beginning to explore opportunities to 
promote pension fund trustee incorporation of ESG into investment 
decisions. Underscoring Powdrill’s point about laws, Laslett notes that 
opportunities in this area are stronger in the UK than elsewhere because 
of recent “sympathetic legislation”, and also because the incorporation 
of ESG into mainstream investment is farther along in the UK than 
elsewhere.99 Relations between unions and SRI may also be better 
developed in the UK than in the U.S.  
2.2.3 General observations 
The rise in labour-related SRI is also evident in new partnerships (see Appendix I), 
increasingly sophisticated approaches of social investors to the issue of ILS, and an 
increase, albeit slow and uneven, of transparency around supply chain labour standards 
among a handful of companies. 
And yet, despite this progress, serious labour rights violations remain commonplace, 
even in the supply chains of companies considered leaders in this area. The recent findings 
of EIRIS on labour standards in particular were discouraging: in all regions but Europe, 
most companies that rely substantially on global supply chains show “little or no evidence 
of having a supply chain labour standards policy. Over 80% of companies in North 
America and Australia/New Zealand and over 90% of Asian companies” have no such 
policy, although over 50% of European companies do.100  
These challenges and others will be discussed in more detail in section II.

2.3 Institutional investors and SRI: Recent data   
Institutional investors, which represent large amounts of money and may hold 
significant shares in public companies, are increasingly incorporating ESG into their 
investment decision-making.  They are doing this, for example, through incorporation of 
ILO core conventions, with child labour and freedom of association considered the most 
important.101  However, moving from “incorporation” of ESG to an in-depth consideration 
of labour-related issues in investment decision-making is a big step, and brings its own 
challenges. 
As mentioned earlier, there are few comprehensive data on the spread of labour-
related SRI per se.  But there are indicators that reflect the long-term, ongoing interest of 
social investors in labour-related issues, as well as some indication of growth in this area. 
This section discusses ILO-commissioned research from 2007, on large institutional 
investors’ consideration of labour standards; data from the Interfaith Center on Corporate 
Responsibility (ICCR) on North American shareholder resolutions around labour-related 
issues; and labour-related indicators connected to a major SRI index maintained by US 
research firm KLD Research & Analytics. It also incorporates qualitative accounts from 
shareholder activists and others in the SRI field.  
Garcia (2007), citing data on two large groups of public pension funds, captures the 
outlines of the trend of institutional investor integration of labour standards in decision-
making:  
Two-thirds of major international public pension funds surveyed by UNEP-FI/UKSIF 
in 2007 (representing almost $3.5 trillion) consider labour standards in investment 
decisions 
15 out of 26 of the major international public pension funds studied by Garcia 
(representing over $4 trillion) do so102 
As Garcia notes, public pension funds are incorporating ESG both to “meet their 
fiduciary duties” and to “minimize the risks” of international investment.103  Overall, public 
pension funds are considered a natural fit for responsible investment, in part because their 
trustees are often publicly elected and, in principle, are more likely than commercial fund 
managers to be authorized to incorporate social issues in investment decisions.104 
Garcia also finds the trend in shareholder activism among public pension funds is on 
the upswing, citing the 2005 SIF report, which noted a 16% rise in ESG-related resolutions 
in the U.S. from 2003 to 2005.  She notes that 20 of 26 public pension funds surveyed use 
proxy voting to “guarantee the long-term health of their investments”.105  It is worth noting 
that the filing of shareholder resolutions on ESG issues is much more prevalent in the U.S.

than in any other country, due in part to the ease with which shareholders can do so.106  And 
while shareholder resolutions in the U.S. are non-binding, they alert companies to issues of 
major concern to shareowners.  
Another set of data comes from the ICCR EthVest shareholder resolution database.  
ICCR is a coalition of 275 faith-based institutional investors that seeks to “press companies 
to be socially and environmentally responsible”.  Among its members are pension funds, 
religious orders, asset management companies, colleges, unions, and foundations.  While 
ICCR does not own stock itself and therefore cannot file resolutions, each year it 
coordinates filings for its members on over 200 shareholder resolutions on issues of 
concern to these member organizations, whose combined portfolio value is about $110 
billion.107 
ICCR’s database shows the following108:

2004 50 43 (86%) 7 (14%) 
2003 55 48 (87%) 7 (13%) 
 
The resolutions counted under “labour rights-related” are those that specifically 
discuss labour issues and/or ILO conventions or standards.109  These include, among others, 
resolutions on vendor standards concerning ILS; discrimination in the workplace; the 
MacBride Principles (fair employment principles for US companies operating in Northern 
Ireland); and child labour.  The more general human rights resolutions cover areas such as 
involvement in Burma, indigenous community impact, use of security forces, privacy, and 
Internet freedom of expression.  Note that the totals above include resolutions that were 
withdrawn.  
The data show a rise, though with fluctuations, in the total number of Human Rights 
and Worker Rights shareholder resolutions from 2003 to 2007.  It is interesting to note that 
over the same period there is a decline in the percentage of labour-related resolutions 
among human rights and worker rights resolutions overall, although ILS-related resolutions 
clearly represent the lion’s share of the total human rights resolutions over these years.  It is 
tricky to interpret the reasons behind the numbers of resolutions.  As one ICCR staff

109 This was the author’s own classification, as the ICCR database groups human rights and labour rights 
resolutions together, and does not break them down into categories, though it does give a title to each resolution 
so that in many (not all) cases, it is easy to tell whether a resolution is primarily labour-related or more generally 
a human rights resolution. 
  23
member points out, fluctuations in the numbers from one year to another may reflect a 
temporary decline in the number of resolutions by a large filer, or could indicate that 
shareholders are involved in more dialogues in a particular year and therefore might file 
less on an issue.110 
Rev. David Schilling, also of the ICCR, has made several observations: (1) there is 
“more energy” in the investor community now around business and human rights more 
broadly, and sometimes “the labour piece gets lost”; (2) most companies are not getting 
resolutions because there are other ways to engage them (through multi-stakeholder 
initiatives or dialogue); and (3) resolutions are only one part of the picture.  That is, the 
agenda has become larger, as opposed to labour being dropped from it, as ICCR has been 
pushing for international standards, of which core ILO standards are a “key piece”.111 
The EthVest database reflects a somewhat similar pattern for environment and 
corporate governance resolutions: that is, a gradual rise (with some fluctuation) in the 
overall number of environment-related and corporate governance-related shareholder 
resolutions.   
Environment-related resolutions include energy efficiency, climate change reporting, 
genetically modified organisms, and water use.  Corporate governance resolutions include 
separation of CEO and chair, executive compensation, and diversity inclusiveness of board 
directors.

Human Rts/Worker Rts 32.78% 10.42% 
Environment 12.86% 14.31% 
Corporate Governance 34.58% 28.03% 
 
A proper interpretation of these figures would require further research, probably 
through direct consultation of a number of filers on these issues. But it is worth noting that 
a number of shareholder resolutions on non-discrimination in the workplace (focused on 
non-discrimination in relation to sexual orientation) have done well each year, many of 
them receiving over 30% of shareholder votes (considered quite high for ESG resolutions) 
and some of them receiving over 90% in a particular year.   
Research is needed in the future on whether and to what degree this type of 
engagement is successful in changing corporate behaviour in the area of ILS, as well as 
improving working conditions themselves. Sections III and IV below provide some 
commentary on these questions.  
The author is not aware of specific data on how often institutional investors remove 
companies (or decline to invest in them) due to labour issues. For example, Schilling has 
noted that ICCR’s focus is primarily on engagement to bring change, not on divestment.  
ICCR data therefore are focused on resolutions and dialogues, though individual members 
do divest from companies on specific issues.112   
Another relevant set of data is that of labour- or employee relations-related removals 
and additions of companies to the Domini 400 SocialSM Index (DS400), the flagship index 
of social investment research firm KLD Research & Analytics, Inc. From 1990 (the year 
KLD created the index) to October 2007, there were 358 removals (and simultaneous 
additions, because each time a company is removed from the DS400, one is added, as the 
index must remain at exactly 400 companies). Of those 358 removals, the vast majority 
(267, or about 75%) were for so-called “corporate actions” (mergers, acquisitions, 
bankruptcy, delisting, etc.). 
Setting aside corporate action removals, the remaining 91 removals are listed as 
“social.” These include companies removed for controversies in issue areas such as 
employee relations, product safety, or environment; and companies removed for 
involvement in activities screened out by the index, such as nuclear energy or gambling. It 
also includes those removed for general lack of a “social story” (i.e. companies that were 
originally placed on the index because of strong performance on social and/or 
environmental issues, but which have declined in these areas and no longer have an 
outstanding social story). 
Of those 91, 11 removals were primarily for labour- or employee-related reasons, such 
as supply chain labour controversies or union relations controversies.  This represents only 
3% of the total 358 removals from 1990 to 2007, but about 12% of the “social” removals 
 
 
112 Ibid. 
  25
Except for Product concerns, this is higher than other individual issue areas represented 
within the “social” removals category.113 
The above data represent only one SRI index in the U.S., albeit a long-established one, 
and a widely used benchmark for those employing ESG screening.114  
In the UK, Adam Ognall of UKSIF notes that UKSIF members include supply chain 
management and labour standards issues among their top concerns.115  This is true for many 
social investors in the U.S. as well.  
 
Box 5 
Trade Unions and Shareholder resolutions on labour issues 
There are notable challenges for trade unions as shareholders: in the U.S., labour unions commonly file 
shareholder resolutions on corporate governance issues as opposed to labour rights issues, because 
companies can make the case easily for the SEC to exclude the latter as “personal grievance” resolutions. This 
affects unions’ ability to file resolutions on labour rights.116  
In the UK, a key challenge to union-led shareholder activism is the difficulty of filing resolutions in general, 
whether on environment, labour or other issues. This is one reason there have been so few labour-related 
shareholder resolutions filed in the UK to date.117  See Box 7 below for an interesting example of one such 
resolution.    
 
Further, data from UN PRI in 2007 show that, among PRI signatories who engage 
companies in their portfolios, investment managers address human rights and labour issues 
at a high rate in their shareholder engagement initiatives, though not as high as governance 
or environment:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
113 Interpretation of past records of removal is not an exact science, as the dataset involved provides only brief 
comments on why a company was removed (e.g. “union relations, employee safety and product marketing 
concerns”). The author is grateful to Karin Chamberlain, Manager of Indexes at KLD, for providing these data.

The executive director of the UN PRI has stated that the level of engagement on 
labour issues was “pretty impressive” and that the issue ranked high among those on which 
signatories engage. He points out that across all issue areas, not just labour, asset owners 
showed lower rates of engagement than investment managers.119 
Finally, Garcia looks at two groups of pension funds: those that are “leading” by dint 
of their total holdings, and those that are “leading” by dint of their holdings and their 
integration of ESG. In the latter group – public pension funds that integrate ESG – labour 
issues figure more prominently in investment decisions (10 out of 15) than they do for the 
group that is leading simply by dint of their holdings (in that group, eight out of 19 
considered labour).120   
It is difficult to tell from just those data whether mainstream numbers are changing.  
Within SRI, ILS have been a major issue since at least the 1990s, so it is not surprising two-
thirds of investors incorporating ESG would say they consider ILS important.  And 
“considering” ILS in this sense can be as minimal as asking a company if it has a policy 
mentioning the ILO core conventions.  
Garcia points out that international entities such as the ILO and OECD, and initiatives 
such as UN PRI, have laid the groundwork for institutional investors to incorporate ESG, 
and that these investors are “seeking clarity and consistency of international standards”.121  
This view is echoed by Thomas Kuh, managing director of indexes at KLD, who has noted 
that “increasingly in Europe, Australia and New Zealand…pensions and other institutional 
investors are adopting screens based on ‘global norms’ such as ILO standards.  This trend 
will grow as more institutions adopt an SRI/ESG/sustainability stance”.122 
In sum, there is a strong and steady history of social investors incorporating labour 
issues into their decision-making, and of SRI activism on labour (particularly ILS) issues.  
But there is much room for growth, including in comparison to other issue areas, and for

more depth in incorporation.  There is also a need for more research on the extent to which 
mainstream investors take up ILS issues in particular.  In recent years, environmental issues 
have accounted for a significant portion of social investor and mainstream investor interest.  
Further, there are challenges inherent to incorporating labour into investment decisions. 
Section II deals with both of these points.    
  28
3 Specific challenges of labour-related SRI 
3.1 Evolution of SRI thinking on labour-related issues 
“Let’s put aside issues of audits and inspection for the time being and ask ourselves 
whether this whole model of outsourcing is sustainable and ethical”.123 
Most SRI funds and indexes, or the SRI research firms whose services they use, look 
at ILS in some form when evaluating corporate ESG performance. There is a spectrum on 
ILS: at the lower end, an SRI ratings agency or SRI fund might simply check to see if a 
company has a labour code of conduct for its overseas operations or supply chain.  
Increasingly, SRI practitioners look for explicit mention of the core ILO conventions.  
Other areas in which social investors and NGOs look to measure corporate performance 
extend beyond the core conventions to areas such as wages and hours, benefits, health and 
safety.  Experts have noted that health and safety conditions constitute one of the easiest 
areas for companies both to measure and to address.   
Regarding direct employees, social investors also look at general work environment 
issues (e.g. benefits and perks, training, internal promotion rates), employee-related 
controversies (e.g. labour-management disputes, retaliation claims), and employee 
involvement (e.g. stock options, cash profit sharing programs).  These data are more readily 
available for direct employees than for supply chain/contract workers (and in some cases, 
such as employee involvement, the programs simply do not exist for contract workers).   
Moving Beyond Compliance   
As concerns have mounted within the labour rights and SRI communities about the 
problems associated with using labour codes of conduct as a benchmark, and the limits of 
monitoring, SRI practitioners are seeking more stringent ways of evaluating performance 
on ILS.  The idea is increasingly to go “beyond compliance”, or “beyond monitoring”. This 
section discusses this trend in more depth.  
There is a well-documented history of the uptake, mostly by western brands, of 
corporate codes of conduct in response to sweatshop exposés that began in the early-mid 
1990s. There is also an extensive literature on the weaknesses of codes of conduct and the 
auditing systems that have sprung from a so-called “compliance” approach to supply chain 
labour standards.  
Problems have included fraud in recording wages and hours, the coaching of workers 
to give auditors answers that (falsely) indicate factory compliance, and the inability of 
auditing to capture serious labour violations such as sexual harassment and lack of freedom 
of association.  
The evolution of thinking among social investors about ILS has tracked that of labour 
rights activists and experts who investigate the implementation of ILS in global supply 
chains.  In the early 2000s there was a growing realization that auditing is not only limited 
as a tool for uncovering ILS violations and incapable, on its own, of preventing these

violations; it is also actually causing or exacerbating problems by putting pressure on 
factory managers to show that their facilities have passed inspection.  
In October 2006, the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), a coalition of NGOs, companies 
and trade unions that aims to improve working conditions for workers producing for the 
UK market, released a report it had commissioned on the impact of its Base Code.  The 
study showed the code had had a positive impact on health and safety, and helped reduce 
overtime and child labour and improve wages.  However, it found the code had been less 
effective on ensuring freedom of association and tackling discrimination, and had benefited 
migrant workers much less than permanent workers.124 
The results confirmed what many observers from organized labour, NGOs and SRI 
already knew: after years of codes, monitoring and auditing, many workers still are not 
better off.  
In the early 2000s, a few key NGO reports had already pointed to fundamental flaws 
in the outsourcing model, and to structural elements that made ILS violations inevitable.  
For example, in its 2001 report on toy factories in southern China, the Hong Kong Christian 
Industrial Committee (HKCIC) noted that although the foreign companies sourcing from 
the factories had codes of conduct, there were serious labour violations in the factories.  
The group argued that the toy companies’ sourcing model itself, including low prices and 
“just in time production”, was a root cause of the labour violations.125  
These revelations were picked up early on by SRI as well, and in 2002 the ETI and 
UKSIF’s Just Pensions released a brief entitled “Assessing Company Approaches to 
Labour Standards: Labour Standards for Investors”.  It was an early example of important 
questions that investors should ask companies about their supply chain management.  The 
brief made specific reference to the following:  
• ILO conventions 
• Integration of supply chain labour standards compliance with buying 
practices 
• Training of staff on ILS 
• Dialogue with trade unions and NGOs 
• Supply chain mapping 
• Grievance procedures  
• Going beyond first-tier supplier performance on ILS 
• Auditors specifically trained in labour rights 
• Public reporting on supply chains

• Independent scrutiny 
• Collaboration among companies126  
Social investors have been trying to ask these questions of companies for several 
years, but because only a handful of companies (mostly in footwear and apparel, electronics 
and retail) have progressed much on supply chain labour standards performance, response 
rates from companies are generally low. Furthermore, reporting on supply chain 
management is voluntary so social investors often have had to rely on spotty and 
incomplete data to evaluate corporate performance in this area. Social investors also have 
continued to push certain major companies each year just to get them to create internal 
vendor standards, which are considered de minimus.  Nonetheless, labour and human rights 
organizations, many social investors, and a few companies have entered the “beyond 
compliance” generation.    
Most fundamentally, there has been a realization for several years (again, with civil 
society organizations leading the charge) that the entire outsourcing model needs 
reexamining, as it seems to be an integral factor driving certain ILS violations.  Certain 
industry-led groups have begun to join the debate, as well.  For example, in mid-2007, the 
US-based Business for Social Responsibility launched an initiative, “Beyond Monitoring”, 
to address the root causes of social and environmental problems in global supply chains.  In 
addition to multinational buyer companies, social investors are among the stakeholders 
involved in the initiative, whose work is centred on some of the points discussed in this 
section (buyer internal alignment, worker empowerment) as well as public sector 
engagement, which is touched on in section V.127 
In moving beyond compliance, and beyond the tick-box exercise of supply chain 
auditing, labour rights groups and SRI look for indications that a company is making a 
good faith effort to address ILS in the supply chain. These can include the following 
indicators, some of which were already among the demands of NGOs and social investors 
over five years ago (as indicated, for example, by the above-mentioned ETI-Just Pensions 
brief):  
• Examination of purchasing practices and how these can cause or 
exacerbate labour violations (for example, unrealistic delivery times, or 
frequent, last-minute changes to orders).128 
• Worker grievance systems. 
• Corporate intervention in labour-management disputes overseas (for 
example, a number of companies have sent open letters recently to 
government officials in Mexico and the  Philippines expressing concern 
about crackdowns on worker organizing).

• Engaging critics, including unions, NGOs and shareholders. 
• Training buyer staff on ILS. 
• Building trust through long-term relationships with suppliers. 
• Training workers in labour rights so that they can monitor the shop floors 
themselves. 
In fact, it is possible to distinguish certain emerging “good practices,” both within and 
among companies.  Many of these, too, have been on labour rights groups’ radar screens for 
years, and were discussed in the ETI-Just Pensions brief:  
• Common codes of conduct, specifically at industry-level: for example, 
the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC)129.  These are multi-
stakeholder efforts involving companies, NGOs, SRI and in some cases 
unions, to harmonize the approach to ILS in global supply chains.  It is 
worth recalling the downsides, described above, to codes, but they are still 
considered an important first step to holding companies and their suppliers 
accountable for supply chain labour standards. The labour rights group 
Maquila Solidarity Network has recently stated that “the emergence of 
multi-stakeholder and industry code of conduct initiatives…has resulted in 
an upward harmonization of labour standards and greater consistency with 
international standards enshrined in ILO standards”. However, MSN also 
points out “significant inconsistencies” across these initiatives, and argues 
that industry initiatives are less stringent than those of multi-stakeholder 
groups.130 
• In this vein, a few companies have called for “brand collaboration” on 
ILS (e.g. Nike, Timberland). 
• In-depth, independent evaluation of corporate impact on supply chain 
labour standards: in 2005-2006, Nike provided access to a team of 
researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to 
evaluate working conditions in several of the company’s supplier factories.  
Nike provided a link in its FY05-06 report to the team’s study, which was 
candid in its assessment of the “limited results” of monitoring, despite the 
resources Nike had expended on it over the years.  Social investors and 
others welcomed the study as a step forward on transparency.  But 
concerns remain about continued ILS violations in the company’s supply 
chain, and about the potential impact on working conditions of Nike’s 
switch to so-called “lean manufacturing”.131

• Transparency: social investors are pushing companies to report more 
candidly on supply chain management, and are sitting on report review 
committees (see Appendix I) as part of the effort to raise the bar on 
reporting.  It is worth noting here Nike’s disclosure in 2005 of its entire 
factory base, a move hailed by the ITGLWF as “groundbreaking”; only a 
few companies have followed suit. 
• Integration of buyers and compliance, including through buyer training 
on ILS (e.g. Marks & Spencer).  An interesting initiative is a buyers’ 
consultative forum spearheaded by the ILO, International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) and BSR, as part of the ILO-IFC joint Better Work 
program, a global initiative to assess labour standards compliance, provide 
training and build capacity at factory level.  In September 2007, BSR was 
chosen to convene an international consultative forum for buyers to 
address working conditions.132 
• Bringing unions into the management of supply chain labour standards: 
one example, cited in Section I, is that of the work between Gap and 
ITGLWF.  In addition, in October 2007 Spanish retailer Inditex signed a 
framework agreement with the ITGLWF on upholding ILS in supply 
chains. The Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) also brings together unions, 
companies and NGOs on supply chain labour standards. 
• Supplier training on ILS: electronics companies such as Dell and 
Hewlett-Packard have been active in this area; social investors have 
monitored this process through direct participation in some of the 
trainings. 
• Experimentation with worker representation in factories. This can be 
controversial, as some see it as a sidestepping of full freedom of 
association, particularly in countries where this right is suppressed.133 
• Worker involvement in social auditing: for example, Timberland 
reported in 2007 that it was working with Verité, a non-profit organization 
specializing in ILS, on a project to involve factory workers in monitoring 
compliance with codes of conduct.134 
• Research on compliance and productivity. There are ongoing studies by 
academics, companies, and NGOs to examine the relationship between 
labour standards compliance and productivity in factories.135  To the extent

these findings strengthen the business case for ILS compliance, they could 
push companies forward.  However, it is important also to underscore the 
ethical and legal – not just business case – reasons to uphold ILS. 
• De-emphasis on audits:  for example, the Fair Labour Association (FLA) 
is focusing less on audits and increasingly on capacity building in factories 
and assessing root causes of labour violations.136 
• Connected to this, an incipient emphasis on capacity building, specifically 
buyer companies working to increase local government capacity to 
monitor labour conditions in factories.137 
• Lobbying: corporate lobbying is sometimes referred to as the elephant in 
the room.  While there are few examples of corporations publicly lobbying 
in favour of ILS protection, social investors increasingly expect companies 
to address their lobbying activities and how these influence social issues at 
both the national and international levels. 
All of these are interesting developments, and some of them are promising.  But there 
are major caveats:  
• So far, relatively few companies are involved in a meaningful way in 
addressing ILS, some of them through labour-intensive, long-term 
dialogues with social investors. These efforts often do not extend to the 
industry level; where they do, there is potential for real change.   
• All of the above are voluntary. While voluntary initiatives have their 
advantages, they tend to attract the companies that are already working on 
these problems, or are open to dialogue, leaving most other companies 
below the radar. Voluntary initiatives are also non-enforceable and can fall 
apart at any time.  
To return to the business model question that opened this section: it is not clear that a 
few companies, along with social investors and NGOs, can push this debate to a tipping 
point. The question of pricing alone is a crucial one: the relentless drive in retail, for 
example, to sell things at lower and lower prices, which, as described earlier, manifests 
itself in ILS violations up the supply chain.  And because low prices are supported – or 
even demanded – by the market (e.g. consumers and investors), they will continue to be an 
integral part of the business model, and thus continue exacerbating labour rights violations.

refer to this as “Supply Chain Management 3.0”, beyond codes of conduct or even multi-stakeholder, common 
initiatives; it calls to mind FLA 3.0 referred to above.

SRI practitioners will continue to struggle with these questions, and their thinking will 
continue to evolve, in collaboration with NGOs, labour unions, and companies themselves, 
on how to respond to these challenges.  
3.2 Labour Vs. other issues:  
how and why take-up differs 
While there seems to be little formal research on the question of whether it is harder to 
get investors to focus on labour than on other issues, a discussion of the key challenges 
surrounding the incorporation of labour considerations into investment sheds some light on 
the issue.138 
There are several explanations for why evaluation of corporate performance on ILS 
differs from that of other areas that social investors care about. These include the 
difficulties of data collection and interpretation, and the comparative ease with which other 
areas (such as environment) can be quantified and shown to represent economic risk or 
opportunity for companies.  This section looks at several of these challenges to 
incorporating labour into investment decision making, and then at how social investors and 
others are addressing – or could address – these.   
3.2.1 Data collection and interpretation   
As a starting point, it is not so much a question of defining labour standards as it is of 
implementing them,139 a point on which both companies and countries fall short140.  
Sometimes investor groups across different regions choose to emphasize different aspects 
of labour standards: for example, within the core convention of non-discrimination in the 
workplace, social investors in the U.S. have put substantial effort into eliminating 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. That particular aspect of non-discrimination is 
not well developed among social investors in many other regions of the world.  However, 
as section I underscored, there seems to be a general consensus among SRI practitioners 
about the importance of core ILS.  
A company’s performance on ILS is often interpreted in relation to its global supply 
chain.  While there seems to be broad agreement across SRI on the main ILS issues to 
measure (core ILO conventions, plus wages and hours, safety and health, and in some cases 
 
 
138 In late 2008, as this paper was being readied for publication, Aaron Bernstein of Harvard Law School’s 
Labour and Worklife Program published an Occasional Paper entitled “Incorporating Labour and Human Rights 
Risk into Investment Decisions” (September 2008), available at: 
http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/lwp/pensions/publications/occasional_paper2.pdf. The paper discusses 
the fact that investors face particular difficulties in assessing labour and human rights risks because of “lack of 
objective and quantitative data about corporate activities in these areas,” (p. 1) and suggests some ways to 
address this.  
139 This point is underscored in a recent joint publication by the International Business Leaders Forum and the 
International Finance Corporation, Guide to Human Rights Impact Assessment and Management: Road-Testing 
Draft, June 2007, pp. 73-74.

“violate their employees’ basic rights with virtual impunity” (Summary, p. 1).

benefits), both quantitative and qualitative data in these areas are often scarce, spotty and/or 
not standardized. 
When dealing with companies’ overseas operations, scarcity and lack of consistent 
data can also be a problem for other issues that social investors care about (e.g. 
environment, community relations). And as companies expand their global operations, and 
investors’ interest in emerging market companies grows, this challenge will follow all areas 
of corporate performance.  
For data points on supply chain labour standards, specific challenges include:  
• the notoriously high turnover of workers in overseas factories producing for 
companies with global supply chains means year-on-year data on working 
conditions, if reported at all, say less about how the workforce is treated 
than the data would if that workforce were more stable. 
• the kind of monitoring generally carried out does not capture the most 
egregious violations, and often provides only a snapshot of labour 
conditions on any given day. 
• as touched on earlier, there is a major problem with falsified data from 
factory inspections and cover-ups.  
• even where there might be standardized indicators across regions, for 
example, on worker health and safety, if regulatory systems are weak and 
corporate reporting is not mandatory, it has fallen in many cases to NGOs 
or labour unions to collect data where they can. Resource constraints and 
lack of access to supply chain factories are among the obstacles to third-
party data collection. 
there is no harmonized system of evaluating or interpreting performance on ILS, even 
where consistent raw data are collected. For example, what constitutes a “minor” 
controversy in connection with freedom of association in the supply chain versus a “major” 
one?  Does this differ from one country to the next?  What is a reasonable indicator or “data 
point” on freedom of association?  
For these reasons and others, after years of practice, even the reports of so-called 
“leaders” on supply chain management reporting (e.g. Nike, Gap) do not necessarily tell us 
how workers are faring. 
Social investors and ratings agencies commonly gather ILS data from the following 
sources:  
• reports by NGOs, labour unions, or researchers in the field 
• direct communication with such parties  
• company public documents 
• direct communication with companies 
• press accounts 
• government documents (if a host government investigates a particular case, 
for example, and reports on it publicly) 
  36
In rare cases (e.g. the Norwegian Pension Fund’s Council on Ethics; see Appendix II), 
a large investor might make a field visit to verify labour conditions or allegations of 
violations. But in general, social investment research has relied on others to do primary 
research. The level of reliability of others’ research can vary.  Social investors tend to 
consider major rights organizations (Oxfam, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, 
Clean Clothes Campaign) and their field partners to be reliable sources of information, and 
are increasingly working with these groups either bilaterally or in multi-stakeholder 
initiatives to address issues of mutual concern, such as ongoing serious labour rights 
violations in global supply chains. This kind of work can increase the level of trust between 
the parties, and facilitate exchange of information. 
In 2006, ILO commissioned the Association for Independent Corporate Sustainability 
and Responsibility Research (Ethibel) to undertake a survey of practitioners to understand 
better which indicators SRI researchers are using concerning labour rights. The Ethibel 
survey shows that SRI research analysts, drawing on the work of labour rights activists and 
experts over the years, have constructed extensive sets of indicators to evaluate companies 
on labour standards. Some of them focus on policies over performance; others, vice versa. 
Some ratings agencies use a point system; some use qualitative grades (best – medium – 
low); some use systems based on indicators; others use a “Conventions conformity 
approach”141, in which they focus on press coverage of breaches of ILO conventions.  
Indicators range from those directly relevant to global supply chain management (e.g. code 
of conduct), to those also relevant to domestic or direct employees (e.g. job creation in 
Europe), to those that are applicable only to the latter (e.g. career management, internal 
promotion rate). 
Lack of corporate reporting and lack of a common approach are two reasons that a 
number of these indicators remain aspirational, while others may be well covered but only 
for a handful of companies.  For instance, according to the Ethibel survey, some SRI ratings 
agencies ask companies whether they have a formal policy statement on minimum living 
wages.  This is an important question, as a living wage is a fundamental element of a decent 
workplace. But the question itself, like many in the area of ILS, generally focuses on 
policy, as it is very difficult to measure a company’s performance on this issue across its 
global supply chain. Anything we might know about performance in this area is largely 
from negative stories by third parties.   
Similarly, if the researcher uses the “Convention conformity approach”, a company is 
judged “compliant” on ILS unless there are stories in the public domain on non-
compliance. This is highly unsatisfactory from the social investor’s perspective of needing 
reasonable information to evaluate and compare companies, since there are scarce resources 
to probe which companies are non-compliant and, as a result, many companies pass muster 
simply by staying out of the press. 
On the flip side, positive performance on ILS – as opposed to a lack of negative 
stories (which one could perhaps call “neutral” performance) – can be harder to determine 
than for other areas that SRI tracks. For example, on diversity, companies in the U.S. must 
disclose certain data on inclusiveness in the workplace. Social investors therefore need not 
look solely at controversies in the area of employee diversity (or lack thereof) but rather can 
use the public record to find reliable positive data.

Indicators Used in Socially Responsible Investment”, research project for the ILO, November 2005, and 
telephone interview with Herwig Peeters, chair, AICSRR, October 25, 2007.  
  37
These difficulties do not mean that some of the raw data on supply chain labour 
standards are not useful: they can be. But for the moment, social investors and their 
counterparts in the labour rights community – as well as companies – are struggling to 
define and standardize indicators that are meaningful in measuring corporate impact on 
worker rights.  And these difficulties have led to a tendency to look more at systems and 
structures than at performance.  Where there is relatively robust research on a company’s 
ILS program, dialogue and shareholder resolutions can be helpful, as they can focus on 
specific areas of concern.  But where information is vague or general (“Company has a 
policy”), investors and research providers must start from the basics.142 
For some institutional investors, therefore, “integration” of labour considerations 
means simply checking that a company has a policy that makes explicit reference to ILO 
core standards, or implicit reference, for example, via implementing the ILO MNE 
Declaration, OECD Guidelines or the Global Compact, and perhaps a system to monitor its 
application (with all the weaknesses of such systems outlined earlier in this section).  The 
challenge is how actually to evaluate a company’s performance on ILS, since adoption of a 
policy is a necessary first step but often meaningless in practice.  
This situation also explains why, even in 2008, many shareholder resolutions still call 
on companies to establish labour codes of conduct or vendor standards, although the 
dialogue between SRI and a number of large companies has moved well beyond this, as the 
above discussion on “beyond monitoring” shows.  
3.2.2 Rights of direct and indirect employees  
It is worth noting that, although they are not always seen in this way, ILS apply not 
only to global supply chain operations but also to direct employees and domestic supply 
chain operations (for example, relations with domestic trade unions, or discrimination in the 
workplace).  But in practice, the evaluation of corporate performance on worker rights has 
been split into that relating to domestic, or at least direct, employees (sometimes labelled 
“employee relations” or “workplace”) and that relating to global supply chains (more 
commonly associated with ILS.)  Information on the former is often easier to collect, in part 
because in some cases companies themselves are required to gather and report on at least 
some of those data domestically.143  
It is possible to delineate between performance on supply chain management and 
treatment of direct employees, but these lines will become blurred with increased 
outsourcing and pressure on companies to take responsibility for ILS in their supply chains.  
The division in interpretation seems to imply that these are somehow different sets of 
rights, and that the rights of direct employees are more important, relevant or “material” to 
a company, but this is a false dichotomy.    
 
 
142 For example, CentreInfo, a Swiss-based SRI research provider, studied 1673 companies from 23 countries. 
Only 6% of the companies had a “formal, clear and detailed policy on freedom of association and right to 
collective bargaining”.  Philippe Spicher, “Human Rights – Best Practice in Mainstream Investment 
Decisions?”, in Human Security and Business, eds. Benjamin K. Leisinger and Marc Probst; Rüffer and Rub, 
Switzerland, 2007, pp. 153-4.  
143 Investors use different terms to describe various aspects of worker rights (“labour relations” might used to 
describe labour-management relations, while supply chain labour standards are often defined as a “human 
rights” issue; and employee diversity issues are sometimes described generally as falling under “employment” 
or “workplace” issues).   
  38
In a related vein, the so-called “sphere of influence” presents a challenge.  Although it 
is increasingly unacceptable for companies to claim that supply chain workers are outside 
their sphere of influence, a double standard still prevails in comparison to other areas of 
corporate social and environmental impact.  It is evident, for example, that a company’s 
impact on consumer safety captures the attention of the public – and the company – more 
easily than the does the welfare of supply chain workers.   
This was brought home in the summer of 2007, when public and government concern 
in Europe and the U.S. erupted over the revelation of lead paint and unsafe magnets in toys 
made for export in China. One generally did not hear companies claiming that they could 
do nothing about product safety measures upstream in their supply chains; the double threat 
of heightened government regulation and potential lawsuits by angry parents loomed large, 
and companies promised to do all they could to eliminate lapses in product safety. But there 
were very few voices reminding the public, the companies and the governments that lead 
paint and other aspects of toy production were harmful to supply chain workers, not just to 
children using the toys.144 Social investors, however, were among those few voices, and not 
long after the story broke they pressed companies on that very point.  In this case, they 
were able to use product safety to bring attention to ILS.145  
3.2.3 Economic risks and opportunities   
Another difference between the evaluation and take-up of labour issues in comparison 
to other issues has more to do with the nature of those other issue areas: specifically, that a 
number of them are viewed increasingly through the lens of the business case, or even that 
of national security and the well-being of future generations.   
Lessons from Environmental assessment 
Environmental issues are perhaps the best example of an ESG issue with rapid uptake 
in the last few years.  Within the private sector, the environment is increasingly seen as 
both a clear risk factor for companies (tightening regulations, climate change risk) and a 
source of opportunity (energy efficiency savings, profits from new “green” products). This 
is a complex phenomenon that is outside the scope of this paper, but it can be explained in 
part by the growing global awareness about climate change; increasing alarm about 
pollution levels in China and other countries experiencing rapid development; and 
geopolitical developments such as the war in Iraq and the rising price of oil, which have 
helped drive the debate on energy dependence and national security. Adding to this 
momentum were the delivery of the high-profile Stern Review on the Economics of 
Climate Change to the UK government in 2006 and Al Gore’s Nobel Prize in 2007. 
A brief look at recent initiatives and news stories on the environment, some of them 
involving SRI directly, sheds light on the continued and growing interest in the issue within 
the investor community.

trillion of assets under management. According to the CDP website, the organization works 
on behalf of these investors to gather climate change and greenhouse gas emissions data 
from large companies and to disseminate information on related “business risks and 
opportunities”146 The CDP benefits from the association of such high-profile figures as 
former US president Bill Clinton, who spoke at the September 2007 UN Climate Change 
Conference, “exhorting the corporate audience to see the profit potential in going green”.147  
CDP is a growing force for pressuring companies to measure and disclose their 
environmental impact.  
Institutional investors in the U.S., including state pension funds, have joined the 
Investor Network on Climate Risk (INCR).  In September 2007, US institutional investors, 
including pension funds and environmental NGOs, petitioned the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC) to require companies to disclose potential risks to their profits from 
climate change.  
The same month, New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo subpoenaed five 
major energy companies to gather information on whether their proposed coal-fired power 
plants carried “undisclosed financial risks” for investors.148 
The US Climate Action Partnership (USCAP) joins corporations and environmental 
organizations in calling on the US government to create legislation capping greenhouse gas 
emissions (www.us-cap.org). In comparison, it would be unusual to see corporations 
pushing for government regulations in other areas of social investor concern, such as 
diversity, labour rights or corporate governance.  
In a similar vein, in October 2007 several large European and US companies formed a 
group called the Supply Chain Leadership Coalition to push suppliers to report on their 
level of greenhouse gas emissions. The Wall Street Journal reported that the initiative 
“comes amid growing concern that stricter climate change laws could drive up costs for 
businesses”. The same article noted that two weeks earlier, Wal-Mart had said it would ask 
suppliers for energy efficiency data, “in partnership with the CDP.”149 While there have 
been examples of corporations joining together to address concerns over labour violations 
in their supply chains, those initiatives have been plagued by the kinds of data challenges 
discussed above, and companies have also claimed that there may be anti-trust implications 
if they group together to push suppliers on certain issues that could be related to labour 
conditions, such as pricing.  
UNPRI reported in 2007 on the participation of signatories in issue-related 
engagement. None of the initiatives were labour-related per se, and the environment 
seemed to get the lion’s share of investor engagement (Carbon Disclosure Project, 
Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, etc).150 This could be changing, however,

as the UNPRI’s Engagement Clearinghouse (see Appendix I) has begun to help investors 
address ILS-related issues.  
It is difficult to think of equivalent, ILS-related examples to most of the above 
initiatives, and labour-related risks have not been defined in such sweeping terms as those 
used to talk about global warming. As Schilling has aptly put it, a “Labour Rights 
Disclosure Project” would not succeed in the same way the Carbon Disclosure Project has.  
Further, once people realize that climate change affects their grandchildren, the “visceral 
connection is made”, and freedom of association for workers “doesn’t have that 
resonance”.151 
Proponents of these environmental initiatives are also aided by being able to make 
clear financial arguments (both positive and negative) about corporate environmental 
impact, particularly in relation to climate change, and by the progress being made in 
measuring and quantifying these impacts. For example, the headline of a recent press clip 
from SustainableBusiness.com underscores the financial motivation behind investor interest 
in environmental issues: “Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank Call Green Business $1 trillion 
Mega-Market”.152   
One study on SRI engagement on ILS notes that for some industries, such as general 
retailers, “issues such as food miles (as opposed to supply chain labour standards), where it 
is potentially easier to quantify materiality, is where the SRI community will get the easy 
wins with the mainstream”.153 
Further, insurance and reinsurance companies have taken a particular interest in 
climate change because of the related risks connected to changing weather patterns, which 
further drives efforts to measure and report on corporate environmental impact (though it is 
worth noting that reporting on environment is not yet standardized, either.154)   
As outlined earlier, labour and human rights issues can be harder to quantify – and 
“monetize”, as one SRI expert has put it – than are many environmental and corporate 
governance issues.155 To give two examples: the market for quantifying and measuring a 
company’s environmental “footprint” – including greenhouse gas emissions – is expanding 
and capturing the attention of investors, companies, banks and insurers alike, not to 
mention the public.  And with governance issues such as executive compensation and board 
independence, investors can often easily frame these in terms of the financial consequences 
of company behaviour, or at least argue in terms of long-term “shareholder value”.

154 For example, Michelle Chan-Fishel of the Green Investments Program of Friends of the Earth, who 
conducted research for the investor/ENGO petition to the SEC in 2007, noted that “disclosure rates [on climate 
change impacts] are improving…but it’s a question of reporting. There’s a lot of variance. Investors need to 
receive information in a format that is consistent and accurate”. Michelle Chan-Fishel cited in Francesca 
Rheannon, “Investors, States and Activists Petition SEC to Mandate Climate Risk Disclosure”, SRI News Alerts, 
SocialFunds.com, October 8, 2007. 
155 The expert, from an asset management firm, was a participant at the UN PRI conference, “PRI in Person 
2007”, in Geneva, July 3-4, 2007.  
  41
The above points notwithstanding, ILS evaluation has the advantage of being based, 
for many social investors (and companies) on a set of standards, namely the ILO core 
conventions, around which there is significant consensus. The fact that those conventions 
are increasingly taken as a starting point for corporate performance on ILS provides a 
foundation on which to conduct research and evaluation.   
The challenges emerge because, as the previous section notes, it is a large step from a 
core convention to the definition of indicators on which to measure performance on these 
conventions. As one key SRI figure has noted, when those in SRI talk about ILS, they are 
referring primarily to the ILO core conventions, but knowledge of these is not “deeply 
embedded” within either SRI or companies. However, he also points out that this 
knowledge rises where SRI engages with unions.156 
Finally, it is important to point out that there are situations where there just might not 
be a business case for companies to uphold labour rights. As three SRI practitioners writing 
in the Financial Times in 2006 asked provocatively:  
“Imagine a company that tolerates massive child labour in a remote developing world 
mining village. Suppose that, for whatever reason, it is unknown to the rest of the world. 
Should we really not care, just because it doesn't happen to impact the bottom line?”157 
In other words, rights such as those enshrined in ILS should be upheld regardless of 
the business case. But this is a hard argument to make in the context of finance and 
investment, where economic risks and opportunities are the central focus.  
3.3  Looking Ahead 
There are possible ways forward on at least some of these challenges. 
3.3.1 Strengthening supply chain reporting.   
With some exceptions, supply chain management reports often fail to reveal the real 
impact on worker rights. As key players such as trade unions, labour rights NGOs, SRI and 
corporations advance in their ability to measure corporate impact on ILS through better and 
more revealing indicators, it will become more feasible to evaluate and compare companies 
on their performance in this area. This will come in part through more comparable reporting 
and evaluation frameworks. It will also come through collaborative work in this area, of 
which there are interesting examples: 
• The UN Special Representative on Business and Human Rights (SRSG), 
John Ruggie, announced in 2007 that he and the labour rights group Clean 
Clothes Campaign (CCC) would collaborate to clarify how to implement 
supply chain codes of conduct effectively.158  This is an initiative to watch, 
 
 
156 Interview of Schilling, op. cit.  
157 Christoph Butz, Stephen Barber, and Jean Laville, “Time for a Rethink on Responsible Investing”, Financial 
Times, November 13, 2007.  
158 “SRSG and Clean Clothes Campaign Collabourate”, October 1, 2007. http://www.business-
humanrights.org/Documents/Ruggie-Clean-Clothes-Campaign-announcement-1-Oct-2007.pdf  
  42
as CCC has extensive field experience on the issue, and the SRSG has the 
ear of at least some of the business world and certain governments.  
• Unions and companies: it is worth watching the collaborative initiative 
between Gap, Inc. and the ITGLWF, mentioned in section I, whose aim is 
to bring unions into the assessment of supply chain working conditions. 
• In a slightly different vein, there have been recent examples of efforts at 
direct engagement of SRI by human rights and labour rights groups on 
ILS-related issues. For example, Human Rights Watch sent an open letter 
to FTSE4Good in August 2007, asking it to review its inclusion of 
Smithfield Foods on its index, given Smithfield’s poor record on 
upholding US labour laws.159 In July 2007, the US union International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters released a report criticizing the labour rights 
record of Cummins, Inc., and called on SRI firms to remove the company 
“from their lists of approved companies unless and until Cummins stops 
and remedies its violations of workers’ collective bargaining rights”.160 As 
a result of the report, the Teamsters began a dialogue with the SRI 
community. And in December 2008, SRI research firm Vigeo and UNI 
Global Union signed an agreement whereby UNI would provide Vigeo 
with data and commentary on companies in relation to labor issues.161  
These examples could herald a new form of direct and public dialogue 
between SRI, human rights groups and organized labour on the issue of 
ILS and what constitutes a “socially responsible company.”  
• The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) seeks to create a framework for 
standardized and comparable reporting on environmental and social 
performance. Challenges remain: for example, in creating indicators that 
accurately capture a corporation’s labour rights performance, and in 
presenting a framework that is “user-friendly” for all. The initiative is a 
work in progress, but standardized reporting remains an important tool for 
SRI. 
3.3.2 Improve coordination 
 Improve coordination between proponents of ILS and others.  The take-up of ILS 
could benefit from social investors – and those working for “worker-friendly investment” – 
forming cross-cutting alliances with those working on non-labour-related issues. There are 
signs that SRI, labour rights groups and companies themselves are increasingly looking at 
the connections between environment and supply chain labour rights, and between the latter 
and product safety. Examples include:  
• ICCR working groups on both ILS and environment have begun to look at 
the overlap between their areas of work. Companies themselves also are

starting to look at environmental issues in supply chains, sometimes in the 
same framework as that of labour standards compliance (for example, Nike 
is examining hazardous waste in its supply chain, although it is not clear 
how much the company is integrating the two). 162 
• As described above, ICCR members used the toy recalls of 2007 to bring 
attention to worker safety and worker rights in the supply chains producing 
these products, thus showing how the incorporation of ILS can be 
bolstered by existing investor (and consumer) concern about product safety 
and other issues. For example, social investors have strengthened ties with 
groups such as the Investor Environmental Health Network (IEHN).  
• The AFL-CIO is working with environmental NGOs to increase 
investment in sustainable energy projects that also create jobs for its union 
members.163   
3.3.3 Boosting corporate response rate  
Boosting corporate response rate to inq uiries on social and environmental issues.  
This might begin to happen as institutional investors such as major pension funds 
demonstrate their own incorporation of these issues. The Norwegian Government Pension 
Fund’s divestment of Wal-Mart in 2006 due to labour rights violations in the company’s 
supply chain was a strong signal to industry that these issues matter to large investors.  
Before divesting, the Fund gave Wal-Mart an opportunity to engage in dialogue regarding 
the alleged labour violations, but the company did not respond, a fact made public after the 
divestment.164  In the future, this kind of high-profile, negative publicity and direct, public 
pressure from a big player could conceivably bring up company response rates on how they 
are handling ILS in their operations. (For more information on the functioning of the Ethics 
Council of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund - Global, see Appendix II.) 
In general, major public pension funds are increasingly incorporating ESG factors into 
their investment decisions (see Section I). A number of these funds (e.g. CalPERs, Previ) 
have traditionally focused on corporate governance issues,165 but to the degree that they 
extend their evaluation to social and environmental factors, labour standards can be 
expected to grow in importance in their decision-making.  Garcia cites pension funds such 
as the Second Swedish National Pension Fund (AP2) and CalPERs as examples of major 
public pension funds explicitly incorporating labour standards into their policies.166

The Challenge”, 2007.

3.3.3 The business case for ILS:  
Several research and evaluation projects are underway, involving companies, NGOs, 
academics and organized labour, to evaluate the relationship between labour standards 
compliance and productivity.  Some of these have generated preliminary results suggesting 
a link between better ILS compliance and increasing productivity, but more research is 
needed.167  Positive results could bolster the case for upholding ILS. 
An interesting example of the business case for human rights comes from a recent 
study by World Resources Institute (WRI), “Development Without Conflict: The Business 
Case for Community Consent”.  Using four case studies from around the world, the report 
makes a strong financial case for gaining community consent in large-scale development 
projects.  Such studies may hold lessons for ILS, though as noted earlier, it is important not 
to rely solely on the business case for ILS, as one can certainly point to cases where a 
company has done better financially by violating labour rights than by upholding them, an 
outcome that is the opposite of what SRI – and its allies – are striving for.

4  Impact of investment practices on 
corporate behaviour    
4.1 Changing views 
“Fund managers have many anecdotal examples of the positive results of 
engagement, but systematic evidence of their effectiveness is very limited”.168  
There is not much formal research on how SRI practices affect company behaviour, 
and it is generally tricky to ascribe a change in corporate behaviour to the actions of one 
particular actor, such as investors, as change is often the result of several influences 
reaching a critical mass of pressure on a company.   
However, social investors have clearly been among these important sources of 
influence in numerous cases.  Further, companies have become increasingly aware of the 
influence of SRI and have sought out social investors on a number of levels.  This section 
looks at some examples. 
In their 2006 edited volume, Responsible Investment, Rory Sullivan and Craig 
MacKenzie included several case studies on shareholder activism and how it can affect 
company behaviour.  The cases show where investors “contributed to” better company 
“policies, management systems and disclosures”,169 but they do not touch on company 
performance on ILS per se.   
In the same book, an expert on business and human rights from Amnesty International 
concludes candidly that while SRI has been one driver of change, NGOs would more likely 
view SRI as an “amplifier” of NGO concerns.170  
As noted earlier in this paper, SRI analysts and social investors have often taken their 
cue from rights groups and other civil society organizations on the ground who are also 
striving to monitor and evaluate corporate social and environmental impact.  On one level, 
this involves SRI “pushing the envelope” by asking companies questions that, if answered 
properly, could help flesh out important indicators on performance.  Even if some questions 
are beyond what a company is prepared or able to answer, the act of asking in itself can 
have, and has had, an effect on companies.  This is evident from the fact that, as some 
companies are turning increasingly to SRI to clarify what social investors want to know, 
these questions get registered as important (see Box 6).

  46
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On this point, UKSIF’s Just Pensions published a brief in December 2005 (for which 
the author was interviewed), assessing SRI engagement around supply chain labour 
standards. A company representative interviewed for the brief emphasized that it was 
important for investors to ask questions that companies might not be able to answer at 
present, so that “the questions would get [the issue] onto our radar screens”.171 
Just Pensions also concluded that effective practice included SRI analysts working 
“collaboratively with their mainstream colleagues and other stakeholders to push for 
systemic change…to tackle endemic supply chain labour standards abuses”.172 
Against this backdrop, below are some examples of the impact of investment practices 
on company behaviour: 
• Report Review Committees (RRC) (see Appendix I): a handful of 
companies, particularly those implicated in supply chain labour 
controversies in previous years, have begun to institutionalize their 
consultation of stakeholders, including investors, around CSR reporting.  
Nike and Gap have done this through stand-alone RRCs; Timberland, 
McDonald’s and others through “stakeholder teams” organized by Ceres, 
a U.S.-based coalition of investors, environmental organizations and 
public interest groups that work with companies on issues of 
sustainability in capital markets. In seeking feedback on their reporting, 
companies are reacting to the growing demand for better CSR reporting 
in general, and the expanding efforts of various shareholders to measure 
and evaluate corporate performance in areas such as ILS in particular.  
As of 2007, 40-50 companies had ongoing Ceres stakeholder teams.173   
• Indexes: companies are sometimes responsive to SRI firms when 
threatened with removal from indexes maintained by these firms. There 
are clear instances in which companies have agreed to enter into 
dialogue with a research firm about a particular issue of concern when

Box 6 
Questions to companies 
SRI analysts’ and social investors’ asking questions of companies may help lead to change: this is one 
of the premises behind the ICCR Purchasing Practices Working Group described in Appendix I.  In targeting 
industry leaders with focused questions – themselves the result of research and interviews with ILS experts – 
the group expects to raise awareness of the effect of purchasing practices on factory working conditions.  The 
group hopes that its findings will bolster efforts of companies already working on the issue, and act as a lever 
to influence more broadly those industries that rely on global supply chains but have not yet made the link 
between procurement processes and labour conditions in manufacturing.1   
  47
an index decision was on the line.  In theory, ESG indexes provide an 
incentive to companies to improve their performance.174 
• Shareholder resolutions and engagement: shareholder resolutions are 
not binding on companies in the U.S., but sometimes the mere 
possibility of a resolution going to a vote has motivated companies to 
enter into dialogue with shareholders, who may then decide to withdraw 
the resolution.  In a few cases, shareholders have filed resolutions 
repeatedly, and some eventually succeed in having an impact on 
company behaviour. (For example, after several years of shareholder 
resolutions on both equal employment opportunity and sustainability 
reporting, Wal-Mart published a Diversity Report in 2006 and a 
sustainability report in 2007. The resolutions were only one source of 
pressure, albeit an important and consistent one.). 
• It is worth noting a fundamental difference between the U.S. and the 
UK: Sullivan and MacKenzie have pointed out that US institutional 
investors, especially faith-based groups, “have been very effective at 
using proxy resolutions to encourage companies to respond” on issues 
including international labour standards in supply chains.  In Europe, 
“this kind of religious, shareholder resolution-based activism has not 
been popular, due perhaps to the smaller scale of religious assets and the 
significantly greater obstacles in filing shareholder resolutions”. And 
yet, mainstream institutional investors have also “undertaken a 
significant body of shareholder activism” on social and environmental 
issues since the late 1990s175 (see for example the actions of CalPERs).  
• Resolutions are only one strategy, and shareholder voting “is generally 
seen as being most effective in the context of a range of other 
activities.”176 See Box 7 for more.

Labour-related shareholder resolutions:  an example 
An interesting example of a labour-related shareholder resolution that joined US and UK players involved 
the British international transport company FirstGroup Plc.  In 2006, the Service Employees International Union 
(SEIU) and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, both US-based unions, came to the UK to speak with 
investors about labour-related concerns regarding FirstGroup Plc's US subsidiary, First Student. The unions 
formed a coalition with the aim of filing a shareholder resolution asking the company to create a workplace 
human rights policy to address these concerns.   
Filers included an SEIU pension fund, the Trades Union Congress pension fund, the large British 
institutional investor Cooperative Insurance Society, and over 100 unionised members of FirstGroup who 
owned company shares. The level of support plus abstentions for the vote was approximately 
15% at FirstGroup's 2006 annual general meeting, considered a large percentage for a non-corporate 
governance-related resolution in the UK.   
The resolution was also only the second labour-related shareholder resolution in UK history, adding to its 
significance.  Although the resolution was filed again in 2007 and received a lower percentage, the company 
agreed to take several steps to address labour concerns at First Student, including setting up a whistle-blower 
hotline for complaints related to anti-union behaviour and hiring consultants to monitor how FirstGroup 
manages industrial relations at First Student.177   
The role of Cooperative Insurance was, in one participant’s view, crucial because it is an institutional 
investor, and because of the high threshold to filing resolutions in the UK.178  The campaign demonstrated the 
potential for collabouration both between unions and investors, and across players located in different 
countries.  It was also the "relative success" of the campaign that led the SEIU to place a full-time liaison in the 
UK to strengthen relationships with the SRI community in the UK and Europe.179 
 
4.2 Impacts on Share Prices 
There is not much solid evidence of companies whose stock price drops were tied 
directly to behaviour in relation to ILS controversies. Anecdotally, Nike, Gap, Inc. and a 
few others have been cited in this context, but it can be difficult to tie stock price 
movements to a single controversy such as a sweatshop exposé.  
For example, Vogel has noted:   
Nike’s labour practices made the giant sporting goods company a target of boycotts, and 
its sales appear to have suffered owing to controversy over its labour practices though it is 
unclear by how much…Typically, even high-profile protests have only negligible financial 
impact…More recent protests have failed to hurt sales at the Gap, Disney, Ford, or WalMart – 
or for that matter, sales of SUVs.  And even when boycotts have an impact, it is usually short-
lived.180 
 
 
177 This account of the FirstGroup campaign is drawn primarily from a telephone interview of Tom Powdrill, 
Head of Communications, PIRC Ltd., December 10, 2007. Powdrill was closely involved in the campaign.

More recently, allegations that Starbucks was “union busting” in the U.S. raised the 
potential for damage to the company’s reputation, but still it is not clear that this would be 
tied directly to its share price: Ethical Corporation cited one commentator as saying that 
the “intangible damage” to Starbucks’s reputation “could be very material”, and that the 
company’s share price had fallen 23% in the past year “for a number of reasons”. But the 
magazine was not willing to tie this directly or solely to the company’s labour-related 
controversies.181 
Finally, after Yahoo! settled a human rights lawsuit in November 2007, the Los 
Angeles Times noted that “investors appeared to shrug off the negative attention”, and the 
company’s shares actually rose over 5%. The Times quoted a financial analyst as saying, 
“Does the brand take a hit? Yes, definitely…Will it have an impact whether people will 
want to do business with it or use their services? No, I don’t think it will.”182 
Because it is difficult to find concrete examples of a controversy driving share price 
(at least for more than a short time), it is even more difficult to find examples of a stock 
price drop forcing a change in company behaviour (and even where this might happen, 
companies generally do not admit that the change is linked to ESG issues).  
On the other hand, many observers have pointed out that for brands and, in certain 
industries such as fashion and retail, reputation accounts for a significant portion of stock 
price.183 
MacKenzie and Sullivan write that “as active managers, our investment decisions can 
influence the share price of companies”. They note that investors have not tried to influence 
share price directly, and it is not clear whether there are actual examples of indirect 
influence due mainly to shareholder action on ESG issues per se. 184   
Powdrill, formerly of the UK Trades Union Congress (TUC), writes that “finding a 
causal link between a company’s behaviour in relation to a particular issue and share price 
performance is the Holy Grail of the SRI community, but remains notoriously hard to 
prove.  What might be termed ‘labour’ issues are no different to any other in this regard.” 
But he notes that health and safety could be a “breakthrough issue” for unionists, in the 
sense that it might be possible in the near future to demonstrate a link between health and 
safety performance and share price behaviour.185 
Clearly this is an area for further research.

4.3 Conclusion 
On one level, EIRIS’s 2007 findings, cited earlier, on the low rate at which most 
companies have established supply chain labour standards policies, are discouraging, 
particularly after years of SRI engagement and NGO and consumer pressure. And Peter 
Frankental of Amnesty has pointed to some serious limitations of SRI:  
• fiduciary constraints dictate that financial aspects trump all others in investment 
decisions 
• human rights issues “are rarely material to a company’s performance or earnings”. 
In fact, Frankental goes so far as to say that “the purpose of the SRI operations of the 
mainstream fund managers” is “not to…bring about systemic change in the behaviour of 
companies” but rather to serve as a “branding exercise”.  In his view, SRI engagement puts 
too much emphasis on the “reputational dimension”, when in fact most companies will not 
face “reputational damage related to human rights impacts” because such damage depends 
on media and NGO exposure, which affects only a fraction of companies. In this light, he 
argues that unless investors keep divestment as an option, they are “disarming 
themselves”.186 
Divestment, or the threat of it, has arguably led some companies to change.  It is hard 
to establish causality, but some argue that pressure for divestment can lead, and has led, 
some companies to pull out of pariah states (e.g. Sudan), though again companies are likely 
to claim that their withdrawal was not due to external pressures over human rights. 
Therefore, the extent to which such “sticks”, as opposed to “carrots”, as Frankental puts it, 
have changed corporate behaviour could use further research.  
On another level, things have changed, in part due to SRI practices.  In the words of 
one expert on SRI trends:  
There’s no question that social investors are influencing corporate behaviour by 
engaging in dialogue with management about issues of concern, filing shareholder 
resolutions and using their social research to hold companies accountable.  Much more 
research needs to be done to quantify the precise impacts of these strategies, but the trends 
are clear: shareholder support for social and environmental issues is increasing and 
companies are changing policies and practices in response.187 
With regard to labour standards in particular, in the view of David Schilling, Director 
of Global Corporate Accountability at ICCR and one of the best-known figures in the SRI 
community, there is “no question” that SRI practices have affected company behaviour on 
ILS.  As he points out, ten or twelve years ago, few companies had codes of conduct.  SRI 
has been a key driver in the establishment of these codes and in the incorporation of core 
ILO standards in the codes.  There has been a “continuum” along which SRI has pushed 
companies, right up to the current ICCR initiative around purchasing practices mentioned 
in Box 4 and described more fully in Appendix I.

University, December 17, 2007.  Humphreys was speaking in his individual capacity (see footnote 95).

In Schilling’s view, company policies would be much weaker – and “much less 
aligned with ILS” – without the influence of SRI.  But he points out that while SRI has 
been successful in influencing company policies on ILS, it has been less so in getting 
companies to implement these policies, especially on freedom of association and 
discrimination, and in pushing ILS in industries where there are no brands.  It has also been 
less successful in affecting the “economic space” in which companies find themselves (e.g. 
the short-term mentality of the financial mainstream, free market pressure for flexible 
labour, a push against unionisation, and so forth).  In this sense, SRI needs to influence not 
just policies and performance, but to look at the big picture of corporate lobbying and 
economic globalization.188 The final section of this paper takes up these and other points. 
Similarly, Sullivan and MacKenzie note that shareholder activism has been less 
successful in addressing “market failure”, and that there is a “long way to go” before 
responsible investment becomes mainstream.189

5 The Effect of Labour-Related SRI on 
Workers’ Rights – Or Lack Thereof  
5.1 Limits of analysis 
The author is not aware of formal research on the effect of labour-related SRI per se 
on workers’ rights.  The previous section made some statements on the effect of selected 
investment practices on corporate behaviour. There are also efforts to examine the effect of 
corporate ILS initiatives on actual working conditions (see below), though much remains 
to be done, at the level of both self-reporting and third-party reporting on how companies 
are doing in that area.  So far, both types of reporting paint a discouraging picture in 
general.  
Further, from there to making statements about SRI’s effect on workers’ rights – an 
indirect relationship – will be a challenge. So it is a two-step process of measuring SRI’s 
effect on company behaviour, and the effect of that change in behaviour on workers’ rights.  
SRI practices       Corporate behaviour          Workers’ rights 
The following are selected examples of research on the effect of corporate ILS 
initiatives on working conditions. There are not, apparently, equivalent examples of the 
effect of SRI on workers’ rights. But to the extent that SRI has provided some of the 
impetus for these initiatives, there could be an indirect connection.  
• The work of the UK-based Ethical Trading Initiative is centred around 
the ETI Base Code, which in turn is based on ILS 
(www.ethicaltrade.org). As described in section II, the ETI’s 
commissioned study, published in 2006, showed decidedly mixed results 
on the effectiveness of the Base Code in improving labour conditions in 
supply chains.190 The study’s results were disappointing. On the other 
hand, the research could serve as a benchmark for follow-up research on 
the effect of corporate behaviour on ILS.  
• Also in 2006 (and also mentioned in section II), a research team from the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), led by Professor Richard 
Locke, released a study, “Does Monitoring Improve Labour Standards? 
Lesson from Nike”, which was subsequently published in a journal.   
• Using data from over 800 Nike suppliers in 51 countries, the team 
concluded that, despite Nike’s “significant efforts…to improve working 
conditions among its suppliers, monitoring alone appears to produce 
only limited results”. The authors argued that “new, more systemic 
approaches” were necessary to raise labour standards. In this context, 
they underscored the importance of “external pressures” (including from 
NGOs, unions and governments), in combination with “management 
 
 
190 Barrientos and Smith,, “ETI Code of Labour Practice…”, op. cit.  
  53
systems” that address “root causes” of labour violations, as crucial to 
improving labour standards.191 
• Although not mentioned in the MIT research, social investors could be 
included in the panoply of pressure groups that the authors list as 
important elements of “systemic change.”   
• Garrett Brown, of the California division of the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA), wrote in 2007 that despite “small 
improvements” in health and safety in many factories in global supply 
chains, “the actual impact of all this CSR activity on working conditions 
on the factory floors…has been marginal.”  He also noted that “there has 
been a flood of reports…indicating that not much has changed”.192   
• According to Brown, there has been “no progress” on the ILO core 
standards of freedom of association and forced labour, and progress at 
only some multinational corporations (MNCs) on child labour and 
discrimination.  Further, progress on occupational health and safety has 
been “undermined” by “conflicting demands” of MNCs.193 
Professor Dara O’Rourke of the University of California at Berkeley has also done 
extensive work on the effect of corporate behaviour on working conditions, including 
specifically on occupational health and safety in global supply chains.194 
Returning to the question of the effect of labour-related SRI on workers’ rights, 
thelack of research in this area is one challenge.  Another is the fact that it is not always 
clear whether what SRI has pushed for has led to better working conditions. Schilling 
points out that Locke et al.’s research on Nike is relevant for social investors, as some of 
the study’s findings call into question certain assumptions that SRI has made over the years 
regarding ILS. For example, while SRI has helped push companies on ILS, social investors 
are not sure if this “translates into empowered workforces” and improved rights.  
Sometimes it does, but in other instances, for example, the result of external pressure is that 
factory workers are fired for trying to organize.195 It is for this reason that research on the 
effect of responsible investment practices on workers’ rights would be useful, despite the 
challenges of undertaking such research.

5.2 Future directions   
There is already a growing body of work assessing the effect of corporate ILS 
programs on worker rights. An effort to look at this in a comprehensive, objective manner 
could yield a clearer picture.   
Company reports, with few exceptions, have failed to present candid, comprehensive 
or comparable accounts of their supply chain management. However, a small number of 
companies are making progress in this area, with consistent pressure from labour rights 
groups, social investors and others. And research such as the Locke et al. study of Nike’s 
supply chain, where the company gave independent researchers access to its data, could be 
promising.  
What is also needed is a systematic assessment, which establishes baselines, of the 
influence of SRI on corporate practice in the area of ILS. This research would have to 
control for other factors that could affect corporate behaviour. This in itself will be 
complex, as will any subsequent effort to draw concrete conclusions about what is 
essentially an indirect relationship: that of the effect of SRI on workers’ rights.  
  55
6 Suggested ways forward  
This section offers select recommendations to various parties on how to improve the 
take-up of ILS in equity markets, as well as on how to address some of the challenges 
discussed in previous sections.  
As this paper has pointed out, there are promising developments – but also potential 
for more robust development – in the area of investment and labour standards. While some 
investors have begun to incorporate ILS into their decision-making, this trend does not 
seem as strong as the incorporation of environmental or corporate governance issues, for 
reasons discussed primarily in section II.  
Further, sometimes the “incorporation” or take-up of ILS by both investors and 
companies is minimal or superficial, not to mention difficult to measure. Companies have 
often failed to protect ILS within their sphere of influence, and investors often lack more 
than passing awareness of what ILS really are. And while investors and labour unions 
should be natural allies in the incorporation of ILS in investment decision-making, this 
relationship could be much stronger, as could organized labour’s exercise of its role as 
responsible investors in general.  
Finally, with a few exceptions, investors have a long way to go to realize their 
potential influence on public policy, not just on ILS but in general. As one expert on ethical 
investing notes, outside of “ethical investors and pioneering pension funds”, investors are 
“the missing stakeholder in most policy discussions on sustainable development”, and yet 
investment has a crucial role to play in this area.196  
The following are a few recommendations, directed mainly at investors, unions and 
governments, but also at international organizations and corporations, since they, too, play 
a key role in promoting and upholding ILS.  
Investors 
• SRI should go beyond evaluating individual companies and also look at 
public policy questions, such as the impact of entire industries or 
business models on society. If responsible investment is to contribute to 
the ultimate aim of sustainable development, investors will have to 
become more involved in “helping to correct market failures”, including 
by pushing governments to address these failures.197 There are, of 
course, challenges involved in investor engagement in policy.198  But as 
one SRI practitioner notes, there are also inherent limits to shareholder 
activism in changing corporate behaviour, and where voluntarism is 
insufficient or there is no business case to be made, only public policy 
“can transform incentives for business to make more sustainable paths

commercially rational”.199 It is therefore vital for investors to be more 
aware of how they can be involved at the policy level.  
• Investors should also focus on systemic issues such as corporate 
lobbying, in order to address the fact that companies may put policies in 
place while also lobbying in direct opposition to the principles 
underlying those policies. In collaboration with a number of NGOs, 
social investors have started the extensive work of uncovering and 
evaluating corporate political influence in various areas, but the work 
has only just begun. 
• Social investors and SRI research firms should strengthen their dialogue 
with organized labour. The FirstGroup case described in Box 7 shows 
the potential for cross-country, cross-sector (SRI and labour) 
collaboration on shareholder activism around ILS. In the area of research 
and analysis, better communication between unions and SRI researchers 
could help address regional differences in indicators such as labour-
management relations. For example, the Ethibel survey reflects 
extensive and detailed questions on freedom of association by one 
ratings agency.200  These data are probably best gathered by both unions 
and companies. But in countries where unionisation rates are low, or 
unionised workers are intimidated, or where there is no dialogue 
between unions and SRI, these questions remain aspirational, and ratings 
agencies can gather very little information on labour relations.    
• When looking at emerging markets, investors and their research 
providers must strive to partner with local researchers in those markets, 
both because the latter can provide better information than non-local 
sources, and because such a process is more likely to build local capacity 
to conduct ESG research.  
Labour Unions 
• Unions can strengthen the take-up of ILS in investment through the 
education of pension fund trustees, union representation on pension fund 
boards, and building relationships with investment managers.201  Section 
I noted some examples of shareholder collaboration between trade 
unions and other investors. There is potential for much more, given 
labour’s major role, for example, in filing shareholder resolutions in the 
U.S., albeit mostly around corporate governance issues.202 
• Unions can also explore enhanced collaboration with other investors, 
including information or research exchange with SRI researchers and

  57
open dialogue on what constitutes good or bad corporate performance on 
labour rights. Where unions are actively engaged with investors – SRI or 
otherwise – the latter will more likely better understand the meaning of 
“mature industrial relations” and the importance of ILS.203  
Governments 
Governments clearly have the primary responsibility to protect labour rights. Outside 
of the obvious recommendation that governments should improve enforcement of their 
national laws and ensure that those laws are consistent with ILS, they should also consider:  
• Redefining or clarifying fiduciary duty to include ESG criteria204 
• Making ESG disclosure mandatory for companies and stock 
exchanges205 
• Working with investors and others to think creatively about how to 
provide incentives for companies to improve their ESG performance206 
• Providing support – directly and through membership in 
intergovernmental organizations – to underfunded areas such as 
emerging markets SRI research, at least to get the ball rolling until a 
market can be created for such research 
International Organizations 
• International organizations should ensure, through their convening role, 
the inclusion of organized labour in multi-stakeholder initiatives that 
specifically address labour issues, and thus the inclusion of the workers’ 
rights perspective207 
• As with governments, international organizations can also provide 
technical and financial support to underfunded areas of research 
• A robust integration of ILS into the social criteria of the UN Principles 
for Responsible Investment (PRI) would extend the reach of these 
standards208 
• International organizations could have a role – as convener or facilitator 
– in fostering a stronger relationship between investors and labour.

Corporations 
The focus of this paper has not been on companies. However, in the realm of policy 
prescriptions on ILS, companies have a role to play.  In addition to the recommendation 
that they establish – and implement – robust labour rights policies and programs, 
recommendations to corporations include the following:  
Use their lobbying power in favour of strengthening ILS: SRI has increasingly turned 
a spotlight on corporate political involvement – including lobbying – and how it can have a 
negative effect on environmental and social protections, and on the flipside, the potential 
for corporations to use this influence to strengthen such protections.209  
Increase efforts to examine the root causes of violation of labour rights, which could 
include rethinking entire business models. Social investors and civil society organizations 
have increasingly pushed on this point, but only a handful of companies seem to be 
addressing it seriously.  
Researchers 
More comprehensive research is needed on the impact of investment practices on 
corporate behaviour, the impact of corporate behaviour on working conditions and, by 
extension, the impact of investment practices on workers’ rights.

APPENDIX I 
Select Mechanisms and Platforms: Information-Sharing, Dialogue and 
Initiatives in Support of Labour-Related SRI 
 
These mechanisms fall into several different categories: networks and consortia, working 
groups or committees, and key reports and studies.   
Networks and Consortia 
ICCR: the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, based in New York, represents 275 
faith-based institutional investors, including religious orders, pension funds, asset managers, unions 
and foundations. Members are primarily from North America, but also from Europe. ICCR 
coordinates the filing of shareholder resolutions; each year, its members sponsor over 200 
resolutions on social and environmental issues210 and are involved in long-term dialogues with many 
companies on issues of concern to investors.  Founded in 1971, ICCR has been a major force in the 
global SRI community, and it has been at the forefront of identifying emerging issues for social 
investors.  The ICCR model of active engagement, while “not necessarily a model for other 
investors”, has been particularly influential in the US SRI community.211 
SIRAN: over 150 research analysts in North America belong to the Social Investment 
Research Analyst Network (SIRAN). They represent 30 investment firms and research providers in 
the U.S. and Canada.  In addition to conducting research and facilitating meetings between analysts 
and companies to discuss corporate performance on ESG issues, SIRAN aims to “provide a forum 
through which analysts can share best practices, thoughts on emerging  issues, and resources” 
(www.siran.org)  While the network has not done much work specifically on labour-related issues 
since its establishment in 2004, its members include those working directly on these issues, and 
SIRAN’s structure is such that any member can suggest more work in this area. 
SIFs: There is a number of Social Investment Forums around the world, including in Canada 
(Social Investment Organization), the U.S. (US SIF), Europe (Eurosif), Asia (AsRIA) and Australia 
(Responsible Investment Association Australasia). Below are a few examples:  
US Social Investment Forum (SIF): a national membership network promoting SRI, its 
members are SRI practitioners such as analysts and portfolio managers, and institutions such as 
banks, mutual funds and foundations.  SIF provides tools such as biennial research reports on trends 
in SRI, industry reports, and SRI mutual fund performance charts.  Its Advocacy and Public Policy 
program coordinates advocacy among members and allows them to share information and 
collabourate on shareholder proposals. SIF carries out its programs primarily through working 
groups such as the Indigenous Peoples Working Group, Community Investing Working Group and 
International Working Group.  SIF tracks labour-friendly investment funds, SRI funds that screen on 
labour- and employee-related issues, and trade union plan sponsors that screen or file resolutions on 
environmental and social issues.  It has recently increased its outreach to organized labour.212 
www.socialinvest.org  
European Social Investment Forum (Eurosif): founded in 2001, the not-for-profit Eurosif’s 
stated goal is to “address sustainability through financial markets”.  Its members are the European 
national SIFs (Belgium, France, German, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, UK), and its member affiliates

include pension funds, financial service providers, academia, research forums and NGOs.  Its 
membership represents total assets of over 600 billion Euros. Activities include lobbying the EU, 
research, and conferences. www.eurosif.org  
UKSIF: a member of Eurosif, the UK Social Investment Forum has conducted a number of 
projects that incorporate labour-related SRI.  For example, in 2005 UKSIF’s Just Pensions program 
produced a brief assessing SRI engagement on supply chain labour standards (see section II).  The 
report highlighted how SRI engagement could be effective in changing corporate behaviour, and 
made recommendations on best practices for investment managers.  Members of the Forum used the 
report as a catalyst to develop their own work on supply chain labour standards.213  UKSIF has also 
begun a new initiative around investor concern about supply chain labour standards.  According to a 
recent update from the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI), UKSIF “has formed a small group of 
investment analysts to develop and review the standards and key indicators that they would like to 
see” in relation to supply chain labour standards.214 ETI, which brings together companies, NGOs 
and unions, is also involved. http://www.eurosif.org/about_eurosif/sifs/uk 
UNPRI Engagement Clearinghouse: this is a private, online forum, open only to signatories 
of the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI).  The forum, created in late 2006, provides 
signatories with a network within which to share information about engagement on various issues.  It 
is meant to help investors harness collective power in influencing corporate behaviour, and to 
address the “tragedy of the commons” problem that reduces incentives for individual actors to take 
action.  In 2007, the Clearinghouse had proposals for work around various ESG issues, including 
forced labour in the steel supply chain in Brazil.  In addition, the New York City Employee 
Retirement System (NYCERS) reported that it used the Clearinghouse to notify other signatories 
about its planned shareholder proposal to Wal-Mart on the company’s noncompliance with ILO 
standards, and as a result several signatories joined as co-sponsors of the proposal.215  As of 2008, 
the Clearinghouse had held at least one webinar for signatories specifically on ILS-related issues. 
Working Groups or Committees 
While more informal in nature than some of the longer-term MSIs described above, several 
working groups or committees focused in part or wholly on labour-related SRI have proven to be 
useful mechanisms for dialogue around raising the bar for labour standards in corporate operations.  
Below are two examples.  
ICCR Working Groups: ICCR (see above) has several working groups that advance the 
organization’s over-arching goal of changing corporate behaviour.  ICCR working groups offer an 
opportunity for members to deepen their work on certain key issues, and to build and implement 
long-term, targeted action plans to achieve change.  A specific priority of ICCR members is 
“eliminating sweatshops” (www.iccr.org), and its Contractor Supplier Working Group (CSWG) 
focuses on this goal.   
In 2007, social investors and SRI researchers in ICCR’s CSWG formed the Purchasing 
Practices sub-group.216  The sub-group is focused on improving working conditions in 
manufacturing facilities by motivating U.S. brands and retailers to integrate effective purchasing 
practices into their daily business.  It formed in response to a growing realization that corporate 
purchasing practices are among the root causes of ILS violations in global supply chains.  The 
group’s strategy includes research, interviews with experts, direct contact with companies, and the 
collection of management tools and best practices in the apparel industry, and ideally will be 
extended eventually to other industries

  61
Report Review Committees (RRCs): as described in section III, a few companies have started 
to use voluntary review committees to provide feedback on their CSR reports.  While most of these 
groups look at a wide range of ESG issues (environment, labour, diversity, governance), some of the 
companies using these committees have had major ILS-related controversies – viz. Gap and Nike – 
and their reports and thus their RRCs have therefore focused special attention on labour issues.  
Gap’s RRC consists wholly of social investors. Nike’s RRC is comprised of representatives of trade 
unions, SRI, environmental NGOs, other corporations, academia, and independent consultants.217  
RRCs serve as useful platforms for dialogue and information-sharing both for companies (by helping 
raise the bar on reporting about ILS and indicating what kind of information social investors and 
others are seeking from company reports) and for RRC members themselves (by providing them 
with an in-depth look at how companies report on complex topics such as supply chain labour 
standards).  RRCs are also increasingly used as a form of report “assurance”: not in the sense of data 
verification, which RRCs generally cannot undertake (nor are they given the mandate to do so), but 
in the sense of a third-party review of the reporting process and evaluation of at least some aspects of 
a report.  
Key Reports and Studies 
While reports are somewhat less dynamic as platforms for sharing information, they are 
important for spreading information and triggering dialogue, including between investors and 
companies.  Below are a few examples.  
1) In 2004, Insight Investment, a UK-based asset manager, and Acona, a UK-based 
consultancy, produced a report entitled “Buying Your Way Into Trouble? The Challenge of 
Responsible Supply Chain Management”.  The report was launched at about the same time as an 
Oxfam International report that also looked at responsible supply chain management.218  It was a 
very public sign that SRI was aware of the structural or “root” causes of ILS violations, and that it 
was paying attention to on-the-ground accounts. While there have been many reports by NGOs and 
unions on ILS violations in the global supply chains of public companies, when a report comes from 
within the investment world, it often resonates with investors and asset managers. 
2) Also in 2004, Insight and AccountAbility, a non-profit institute based in the UK, published a 
report entitled, “Gradient: Promoting Best Practice Management of Supply Chain Labour 
Standards”.  The report compared 35 UK companies in several sectors on their management of 
supply chain labour standards.  A UKSIF official interviewed listed the report – and the fact that the 
authors made the benchmark publicly available – as an example of a key mechanism for sharing 
information on the issue of ILS.219  
3)  As detailed in section II, in 2002 UKSIF’s Just Pensions program and the ETI 
collabourated on a brief, “Assessing Company Approaches to Labour Standards: Labour Standards 
for Investors”.  The brief served as an early set of guidelines to investors on what to look for in 
corporate performance on ILS.  
4) The 2007 Moskowitz Prize for Socially Responsible Investing, an annual award for 
research, was given to a Wharton study that found that companies on the 100 Best Places Companies 
to Work For list outperformed industry benchmarks.220

Appendix II: 
A closer look at Council on Ethics for the Norwegian Government 
Pension Fund – Global 
Ms. Pia Goyer, Senior Advisor, Council on Ethics 
 
The Norwegian Government Pension Fund – Global is one of the world’s largest single owner funds. 
As at February 2008, the fund had invested in approximately 7 400 listed companies and has a value 
of about USD 425 billion (2 200 billion NOK).  
The fund is owned by the Ministry of Finance and is managed by the Norwegian Central Bank 
(Norges Bank). In 2004, the Norwegian Parliament adopted ethical guidelines for the fund which are 
based on two ethical obligations. The first one is that future generations should derive benefits from 
the fund, meaning that the fund should achieve a sound return in the long run. The second obligation 
is to respect basic rights of persons affected by the business activities that the fund has invested in. 
This means that the fund should not be invested in companies representing an unacceptable risk that 
the fund will be complicit in grossly unethical activities.  
The guidelines build on a three-track strategy which is: 
• Exercise of ownership rights (Norwegian Central Bank) 
• Negative screening (Council on Ethics) 
• Ad-hoc exclusion (Council on Ethics) 
The Council on Ethics was also established in 2004. It was decided that the members of the Council 
should be selected and appointed by the Ministry of Finance and that the members should be chosen 
so that their professional background would correspond to the criteria in the guidelines.  Being 
responsible for the negative screening and the ad-hoc exclusion mechanisms, the Council on Ethics 
gives advice to the Ministry of Finance on the exclusion of companies from the investment universe. 
The Council has its own secretariat that conducts fact-finding and information gathering, reports to 
the Council and drafts the recommendations on exclusion. The secretariat evaluates about 80 cases 
each year and considers in brief some 500 additional cases. The Council on Ethics meets for a one-
day meeting every month. In 2007, the secretariat had 6 full time researchers and three screening 
agencies to help with the screening of the fund’s investment universe in relation to the criteria in the 
guidelines. The budget of the Council on Ethics and it secretariat in 2007 was about USD 1.2 million 
(NOK 6 million). This covers the entire operation such as salaries, compensation to the members of 
the Council, commissioning of studies, travel expenses and office rental etc.  
In the mandate of the Council it is stated that: 
“the Council shall issue recommendations on: 
1. negative screening of companies on the basis of production of weapons that through 
normal use may violate fundamental humanitarian principles 
2. exclusion of companies from the investment universe because of acts or omissions 
that constitute an unacceptable risk of contributing to, inter alia: 
• -serious or systematic human rights violations, such as murder, torture,  
• deprivation of liberty, forced labour, the worst forms of child labour and 
other forms of child exploitation 
• -grave breaches of individual rights in situation of war or conflict 
• -severe environmental damage, gross corruption, other particularly serious 
violations of fundamental ethical norms”. 
It should be emphasized that the guidelines state that previous conduct constituting breaches of the 
guidelines is not sufficient in itself for an exclusion to come into question, there also has to exist an 
  63
unacceptable risk for breaches in the future. As the main focus of this publication is labour rights 
issues, the other criteria will be not be presented further here.  
The assessment of a case starts by the secretariat receiving information about allegations claiming 
that a company is involved in activities that might be in contravention of the guidelines. This 
information is received by way of information providers, meetings with civil society and ad-hoc 
inquiries by the secretariat. Having obtained relevant information, the first step is for the secretariat 
to make an introductory examination of the facts and allegations of the case which is presented to the 
Council. The Council then decides whether the secretariat should go deeper into the case and prepare 
a background report building on available and relevant information. The Council can also decide to 
engage its secretariat in conducting research to verify the allegations at hand and to obtain additional 
information through, inter alia, commissioning external studies and expert assessments, meeting with 
key stakeholders, or conducting field work.  
The background report, which often is very much the same as the final recommendation, is then sent 
to the company for comments. This principle of contradiction is explicitly stated in point 4.5 of the 
guidelines. The company’s comments are then considered thoroughly by the Council. If the Council 
finds that there still exists (despite of the reply from the company) an unacceptable risk that the fund 
through its investment will contribute to unethical activities, the final recommendation on exclusion 
is prepared. This document also reflects the reply that has been given by the company in question. 
The recommendation is then sent to the Ministry of Finance which takes the final decision on 
exclusion. If the Ministry decides to follow the recommendation, the Norwegian Central Bank is 
instructed to sell the shares in the company (this usually takes two to three months). When this has 
been conducted, the recommendation is published in its entirety. If the Ministry decides not to act in 
accordance with the Council’s recommendation, it can then be published immediately. 
In the Council’s recommendations that deal with human rights and labour rights, there is a reference 
to the guidelines’ preparatory works concerning the status of international conventions in the work 
of the council. There it is stated that:  
“Since international law expresses a balancing of interests between states it is difficult to 
derive norms of action for market actors from international law. On the other hand, international 
conventions give concrete form to the content of an international consensus on minimum 
requirements which should be imposed regarding respect for basic rights worldwide”. 
Among the conventions that are mentioned in the preparatory works representing such minimum 
requirements are the eight core ILO conventions together with the Convention 169 concerning the 
rights of indigenous and tribal peoples.  
The Council’s evaluations are discretionary. The aim of the Council’s work is not to establish a 
formula that can fit all future cases covering the same criteria, but to make a thorough evaluation of 
the merits of each case individually. This means that the Council does not consider itself bound by 
past recommendations, but can chose to put emphasis on different elements in different cases making 
a comprehensible evaluation in each case. The Council’s work has however resulted in the 
establishment of certain conditions for the evaluation of the link between a company’s activities and 
the violations in question, which are presented below.   
At present, the Council has issued recommendations on the exclusion of companies because of 
violations of labour standards twice. In a recommendation on exclusion published in 2006, where a 
company was excluded from the fund because of complicity in serious or systematic human rights 
violations (labour rights), the Council referred to the ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of 
Child Labour, the ILO Convention 29 on Forced Labour, the ILO Convention 87 on Freedom of 
Association and the ILO Convention 100 on Equal Remuneration. One peculiarity is that this case 
did not only assess the working conditions of the company’s own employees, but also those of the 
company’s subcontractors. The size of the company and its possibilities to influence the working 
environment in its suppliers’ activities was an important element of the Council’s assessment. The 
Council stated in the recommendation that the company: 
“wields substantial influence in regard to working environment, wages etc., particularly in 
relation to the manufacturers which the company itself describes as direct suppliers. This is due not 
least to the company’s size and widespread presence in many countries, and thus to its engagement 
in a large number of suppliers”.  
It was also stated in the recommendation that: 
“It seems clear that a number of the violations reported, particularly in the supply chain, are 
very serious. They include violations of fundamental international standards with regard to child 
labour, working conditions bordering on forced labour, serious violations of work hour provisions, 
  64
wages below the local legal minimum, health-hazardous working conditions, and unreasonable 
punishment. Isolated occurrences of this type, even if serious, would probably not suffice to exclude 
a company since such events would not constitute sufficient grounds for establishing a risk of 
violation in the future”. 
The Council noted the total sum of violations and concluded by stating that:  
“It appears to be a systematic and planned practice on the part of the company to operate on, 
or below, the threshold of what are accepted standards for the work environment. Many of the 
violations are serious, most appear to be systematic, and altogether they form a picture of a 
company whose overall activity displays a lack of willingness to countervail violations of standards 
in its business operations”. 
In human rights (and labour rights) cases, the Council operates with four conditions that have to be 
met in order to conclude that a company is complicit in the breaches and that there therefore exists 
an unacceptable risk that also the fund through its investment can be considered complicit in these 
breaches in the future. The conditions are as follows:  
• there must be some kind of linkage between the company’s operations and the existing 
breaches of the guidelines, which must be visible to the Fund, 
• the breaches must have been carried out with a view to serving the company’s interests 
and to facilitate conditions for the company, 
• the company must either have contributed actively to the breaches, or had knowledge of 
the breaches, but without seeking to prevent them, and 
• the norm breaches must either be ongoing, or there must exist an unacceptable risk that 
norm breaches will occur in the future. Earlier norm breaches might indicate future 
patterns of conduct. 
In a recommendation published in 2006, the Council assessed allegations against a company because 
of violations of human rights (labour rights) in its activities in Burma. The main allegations in that 
case concerned forced labour. The Council emphasized in its recommendation that both the UN 
Commission on Human Rights and the ILO, on several occasions, had reported on and condemned 
the Burmese regime’s systematic violations of human rights and use of forced labour. The Council 
found that the company had been involved in forced labour and several other grave violations and 
concluded that the company therefore had been involved in serious or systematic human rights 
violations as stated in the guidelines. For an exclusion to come into question, there has to exist an 
unacceptable risk for future breaches. The fact that the actual construction of the pipeline was 
finished, and that the company seemed to have changed its human rights policy, made the Council 
conclude that there was no "unacceptable risk" of future breaches. The Council thus concluded by 
not recommending an exclusion of the company in question.
