Does Presentation Order Impact Choice After Delay? 
 
Abstract 
Options are often presented incidentally in a sequence, but does serial position impact 
choice after delay, and if so, how?  We address this question in a consequential real-
world choice domain.  Using 25 years of citation data, and a unique identification 
strategy, we examine the relationship between article order (i.e., position in a journal 
issue) and citation count.  Results indicate that mere serial position affects the 
prominence that research achieves:  Earlier-listed articles receive more citations. Further, 
our identification strategy allows us to cast doubt on alternative explanations (i.e., 
editorial placement) and instead indicates that the effect is driven by psychological 
processes of attention and memory.  These findings suggest that subtle presentation 
factors can bias an important scientific metric and deepen understanding of how 
presentation order impacts choice. 
 
 
KEYWORDS: Order Effects, Choice 
Order Effects After Delay 3 
Citations are seen as an objective measure of scholarship (Hamermesh, Johnson, 
& Weisbrod, 1982; Smart & Waldfogel, 1996) and are used to determine everything from 
hiring and tenure to journal and department prestige to society membership and grant 
funding (Garfield, 1999). But could the order in which articles happen to appear in a 
journal issue impact the number of citations they receive?  Could mere article order 
influence impact?  
While the answer to this question has obvious implications the use of citations as 
an objective quality metric, it also provides important insight into how serial position 
impacts choice.  Order effects have been examined across a variety of literatures, but 
existing work has focused on situations where processing is motivated and choice (or 
evaluation) is immediate.  People are asked to select their favorite option from a set of 
possibilities (Mantonakis, Rodero, Lesschaeve, &Hastie, 2009) or to remember 
information from a long list (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966).  But what about the 
preponderance of real-life situations where consumers have no motivated reason to study 
the options, or just happen to browse them out of interest?  People browse the New York 
Times Bestseller list while reading the rest of the paper or scan restaurant menus on the 
way to another event.  Might mere presentation order influence later choices?  And if so, 
which sequence positions are optimal? 
This paper examines how order effects influence choice after delay, even in a 
situation where exposure to the information may be more casual than motivated.  Further, 
we examine these effects in a consequential real-world setting.  Using 25 years of citation 
data, and a unique identification strategy, we examine whether the order in which articles 
appear in a journal issue influence the number of citations it receives. The results deepen 
Order Effects After Delay 4 
understanding of order effects on choice, and along the way, shed light on the objectivity 
of citations as a measure of scholarship. 
 
Effects of Serial Position on Choice 
 
Some research suggests there are primacy effects on choice, or benefits to being 
first or early in a sequence (Becker, 1954; Berg, Filipello, Hinreiner, & Sawyer, 1955; 
Carney & Banaji, 2008; Miller & Krosnick, 1998). When consumers are asked to taste 
and pick their favorite beer from a set of four, for example, the first option tends to be 
chosen more often (Coney, 1977).  Similarly, taste testers tended to prefer the first food 
option they tried (Dean, 1980). 
Other work, however, has found recency effects, or benefits from being later or 
last in a sequence (de Bruine 2005, Houston, Sherman, & Baker, 1989; Li and Epley, 
2009; Nisbett & Wilson, 1977).  When choosing between pairs of stockings, consumers 
tended to prefer the option that came last (Nisbett & Wilson, 1977).  Similarly when 
choosing items from a set of good paintings, jelly beans, or songs, participants tended to 
choose the last item in the set (Li & Epley, 2009).   
Overall then, while some studies have examined how location in a sequence 
influences choice, it remains unclear which position is most advantageous (see Li & 
Epley, 2009; Mantonakis et al., 2009 for potential moderators).   
 Further, there has been little attention to how serial position might affect choice 
after delay.  Existing research has focused on situations where choice directly follows 
exposure to the options. People tasted food, examined stockings, or listened to songs and 
Order Effects After Delay 5 
then immediately made their choice.  In many real world situations, however, there is a 
substantial delay between exposure and choice.  People may read movie listings or scan 
travel blogs, only to make their actual decisions weeks or months later. Might the order in 
which options are presented impact choice after delay, and if so, how? 
 There has also been little attention to whether serial position effects occur in 
situations where people browse through lists without an explicit choice goal in mind (e.g., 
pick the best). Existing research has focused on cases where judges and participants knew 
they would be exposed to a set of options and would have to make a choice at the end of 
the set.  This likely led them to carefully process the different options and examine each 
in the sequence (Mantonakis et al., 2009).  But while consumers sometimes actively scan 
information in the service of a choice they are about to make, other times they may just 
happen across that information without any explicit choice goal or along the way to doing 
something else.  People may come across a bestseller list without any explicit plan of 
buying a book, for example, yet presentation order might still impact what book they end 
up buying in the future. What happens when people just happen to be exposed to 
sequential information, and may or may not need to remember it or ever make a decision 
about it ever again?   
 Finally, what about situations where choice is not required or multiple options 
may be chosen?  Prior work has focused on cases where participants are asked to choose 
only one option from the sequence.  They are asked to pick their favorite beer, song, or 
stocking from the available set, but in many real world situations, choice is optional.  
Students may scan a list of courses without having to pick one or browse the electronics 
Order Effects After Delay 6 
aisle without any specific plan to buy.  In other cases, people may even end up selecting 
multiple options. Might serial position effect choice in such situations, and if so, how? 
 
The Current Research 
 
This paper examines whether the order that items appear in a sequence impacts 
choice after delay, even in situations where exposure is more incidental than motivated 
and choice is not required.  In particular, we suggest that items that appear earlier (e.g., 
first) items should be more likely to be chosen (i.e., primacy effects).  Especially in 
situations where exposure to the items is casual rather than motivated, earlier items are 
more likely to be seen.  Most people start at the top of lists, for example, meaning that 
earlier items should be more salient, easier to find, and receive more attention (Salganik, 
2007). Position may also impact what is remembered.  The serial position curve is one of 
the most studied results in memory (see, for example, Murdock, 1960), and due to less 
proactive interference, and other factors, items presented earlier in lists are more likely to 
be remembered, particularly after delay (Glanzer & Cunitz, 1966).1 Taken together, this 
suggests that earlier items should be chosen more often. 
 
A Field Test 
 
We examined whether the order in which articles appear in a journal impact the 
number of citations they receive (see Haslam, Ban, Kaufmann, Loughnan, Peters, 
                                                 
1 People may also implicitly prefer things presented first (Carney & Banaji, 2008), but given these effects 
are weaker when people deliberate, this mechanism seems like a less likely to drive what articles get cited. 
Order Effects After Delay 7 
Whelan, & Wilson, 2008; Quiñones-Vidal, López-García, Peñaranda-Ortega, & Tortosa-
Gil, 2004 for other research using citations in psychology). Article order is a particularly 
good domain to examine because (1) items are displayed in a sequence but (2) people are 
not required to process all options, (3) choice is optional, and (4) selection tends to occurs 
after delay.  Articles are published in a particular order in a journal issue, and most 
journals have a table of contents listing the articles in the order they appear (e.g., on the 
cover as well as online).  Readers can expose themselves to whichever articles they want 
and they are not required to cite any articles upon initial exposure.  Further, while 
researchers certainly seek out particular articles to cite at a given point in time, most 
situations where article order could have an effect occur after a delay (i.e., people see an 
article when it is released and then cite it months or years later).  We predict that articles 
that appear earlier (e.g., first) would receive more citations. 
It is worth noting that given citations are seen as an unbiased, objective measure 
of quality, they are a particularly strong test of order effects. Further, given that papers 
can only be cited if they relate to a particular topic, one could argue they should not be 
influenced by simple context type effects.   Consequently, if presentation order influences 
citation count it would underscore the importance of presentation order on choice.   
 
Method 
 
Our approach uses a unique identification strategy to disentangle order effects 
from alternative explanations. One could argue that journal editors assess quality a priori, 
and place better articles earlier (Smart & Wladfogel, 1996; Stremersch, Verniers, & 
Order Effects After Delay 8 
Verhoef, 2007; van Dalen & Henkens, 2001).  Alternatively, even if this is not actually 
the case, if readers think this is true, they might believe earlier articles are better quality 
and cite them more.  Consequently, any observed relationship between article order and 
citations could be due to editorial placement or perception rather than order effects. 
To disentangle these possibilities, we collected data from a journal (Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology-JPSP) that is divided into three independently edited 
sections, alphabetically ordered by research area (i.e., Attitudes and Social Cognition, 
Interpersonal Relations and Group Processes, and Personality Processes and Individual 
Differences, see Figure 1). Accepted articles are published separately by section. 
Consequently, while individual editors determine article order in their section, articles 
that lead off the first section should be more salient because they are the lead article in 
the overall journal issue. 
These independently edited sections allow us to scrutinize the link between order 
and citations. If earlier articles in a section get more citations solely because editors place 
better articles earlier, or because people assume earlier articles are better, then the 
relationship between article position and citations should be similar across sections.  In 
contrast, if the citation boost for first articles in a section is greatest for the first section, it 
suggests something beyond mere editorial placement, or reader lay theories, is at play.2 
The first article in the first section leads off the issue and should be most likely to be 
salient, seen, and remembered, even by readers that tend to read articles from other 
                                                 
2 This identification strategy requires a journal with (1) different sections that are (2) independently edited, 
where (3) section choice is not based on article length and (4) most articles sent to one section could not 
easily be sent to another.  The journal must also have these characteristics for a long enough time period to 
generate a reasonable dataset.  Some journals have different sections based on article length (e.g., 
Psychological Science), but this may introduce confounds.  Other journals allow authors to submit to 
different topical sections, but a single editor then chooses article order for the whole journal rather than 
articles being published in contiguous topical sections (e.g., Management Science).   
Order Effects After Delay 9 
sections.  Thus examining the interaction of article order and section sheds light on the 
drivers behind any observed effects. 
We collected citation counts for all regular articles published from 1980 to 2005 
(almost 5,000 articles) using Institute for Scientific Information’s Web of Science citation 
index.  We also recorded article position, both overall and within section. Importantly, 
because articles in a certain section may just generally receive more citations, we include 
section fixed effects. We also control for the number of articles in a particular section in 
each issue (since it could impact the attention a given article receives), and since older 
articles have had longer to accumulate citations, we control for time using a year fixed 
effects.  A few articles receive many more cites than the rest, so we excluded outliers that 
received more than three standard deviations above the mean number of citations.  
Retaining these outliers, however, and analyzing the log of citations provides similar 
results.   
 
Results 
 
First, we examined the relationship between article order in the entire journal and 
citations (see Figure 2 for a graphical representation).  There is a negative relationship 
between article order and position such that earlier articles received more citations (Table 
1, model 1: b = -.99, SE = .18, p < .001). While far from conclusive, this provides 
preliminary evidence of primacy effects. 
Second, to provide a stronger test of whether presentation order is actually leading 
articles to be cited more, we examine how the relationship between article order and 
Order Effects After Delay 10 
citations varies across the different sections (see Figure 3).  As predicted, while articles 
that appeared earlier in any section generally received more citations (Table 1, model 2, b 
= -4.05, SE = 1.12, p < .001), more importantly, this relationship was stronger in the lead 
section compared to either the second (b = 3.58, SE = 1.81, p < .05) or third sections (b = 
2.27, SE = 1.18, p < .06).   
This pattern indicates that serial position has a primacy effect on choice after 
delay and casts doubt on alternative explanations for the effect.  While one could argue 
that editors place better articles earlier, or that people assume that earlier articles are 
better quality, these main effect explanations have trouble explaining the interactive 
pattern of results, or why the relationship between article order and citations differs 
across sections.  We not only find a citation boost for appearing earlier in a section, we 
also find that the boost is greatest for articles in the first section, which are the ones that 
should benefit most from primacy effects.  Further, while certain sections (research areas) 
may simply be more popular (something we control for using section areas), this would 
shift the intercept, but cannot explain why the slope within the section varies across 
sections.  
Ancillary tests rule out alternative explanations even further.  First, we contacted 
all living section editors from the period studied and asked what, if any, strategies they 
used when placing accepted articles during their editorial tenure.  The most common 
response was ordering articles by order of acceptance.  There was no difference in 
reported strategies across sections and editors of the first section did not report using 
article quality to determine position any more than editors of the other sections.  Most 
importantly, we still find an effect of article order on citation count, even among the 
Order Effects After Delay 11 
subset of editors who claim random placement.  The fact that article order is linked to 
citation count even in cases where editors explicitly noted they did not order articles by 
quality, casts strong doubt on editorial placement as an alternative explanation.3 
Second, we looked at the pattern of effects over time.  The shift towards 
electronic databases and reading articles online means that more readers find articles 
without ever seeing what order they appeared in the journal.  This provides yet another 
opportunity to tease apart primacy effects from potential alternative explanations. If the 
relationship between article order and citations is driven by editors placing better articles 
first, then it shouldn’t matter whether people find articles through reading the journal or 
electronic databases.  Earlier articles would be of higher quality and get cited more 
regardless.  If primacy effects are at work, however, they may weaken with reliance on 
online databases because fewer people happen across the earlier articles as they peruse 
the journal, and thus the benefits of appearing earlier should be reduced.  To examine 
time dynamics, we interacted position in overall the journal with years since publication 
to model 1.  Consistent with primacy effects, and inconsistent with editorial placement, 
results indicate a significant negative interaction (b = -0.14, SE = 0.03, p < .001), 
suggesting that the relationship between article order and citations was stronger 
previously than it is now.

3 Another alternative explanation is that quality differences between first and other articles are somehow 
larger in the first section.  Though possible, this appears unlikely.  The first two sections contained similar 
numbers of articles, making it doubtful that greater variance caused by more articles drove the effect. 
Further, for this to drive the results editors would still have to accurately place the highest quality articles 
first, which editor correspondence shows did not occur most of the time. 
Order Effects After Delay 12 
To avoid assumptions about the linearity of the relationship between article order 
and citations, we compared the first article in each section with the rest of the articles in 
that section, across sections. Results were similar to the main analyses. For example, the 
first article in the first section received an average of 79.23 cites (SE = 3.90), while the 
rest of the articles in that section received an average of only 62.29 cites (SE = 2.07).  In 
contrast, while the first article in the 2nd section (M = 54.18, SE = 3.88) and 3rd section 
(M = 62.19, SE = 3.92) did receive more cites than other articles in their sections (M = 
51.15, SE = 2.35 and M = 59.79, SE = 1.48 respectively), the boost was much smaller.  
More rigorous analysis (Table 1, model 3) shows that the first article in any section 
generally received more citations than the rest of the articles in that section (b = 17.79, 
SE = 4.27, p < .001). More importantly, the citation boost for being first in a section was 
greater in the lead section compared to either the second (b = -15.77, SE = 6.12, p < .01) 
or third sections (b = -13.56, SE = 5.89, p < .02).  This pattern further supports the notion 
that primacy effects influence choice after delay.   
Results are also robust to alternate ways of controlling for time.  The main 
analyses used year fixed effects to avoid imposing any assumptions on the relationship 
between time and citations, but time can also be captured by the number of years that 
have passed since publication.  Including time in this fashion, however, as well as time-
squared to allow for nonlinearity, reveals similar results (Table 1, Models 4-6). 
 
Recency Effects 
We also examined the presence of recency effects.  One could argue that latter 
items have less retroactive interference, for example, and thus should be more likely to be 
Order Effects After Delay 13 
chosen.  First we looked at position in the overall journal.  We examined how citations 
varied based on whether an article appeared last in the journal, 2nd to last, 3rd to last, and 
so on.  There was no evidence, however, that appearing later led articles to get more 
citations.  If anything, however, articles that appeared later in the journal actually 
received fewer citations (b = .82, SE = .22, p < .001).  The last article in the journal, for 
example, received fewer citations then the second to last article (Mlast = 38.81 vs. M2nd to 
last = 49.49). 
We also looked at position in each individual section, examining how citations 
varied based on whether an article appeared last in any section, 2nd to last, 3rd to last, and 
so on.  Again, however, there was little evidence of recency effects.  First, looking across 
sections found that the last article in a section received slightly fewer citations than the 
2nd to last article (Mlast = 53.03 vs. M2nd to last =56.99; β = 4.01, SE = 2.79, t = 1.44, p = 
.15).  Second, looking at each section individually found similar results.  The last article 
in a section did not receive significantly more citations than the second to last article in 
any of the three sections (1st section: Mlast = 55.08 vs. M2nd to last =61.09, p > .20; 2nd 
section: Mlast = 52.66 vs. M2nd to last =49.57, p > .47; or 3rd section: Mlast = 52.82 vs. M2nd to 
last = 61.60, p > .09). 
 
General Discussion 
 
Analysis of field data from a consequential real-world domain suggests that 
presentation order impacts choice after delay, even in situations where exposure is more 
incidental than motivated and choice is not required.  Articles that appeared earlier in a 
Order Effects After Delay 14 
journal issue, or earlier in a topical section of a journal, were cited more frequently.  
Importantly, however, this relationship varied across sections.  The citation boost for 
appearing early in a section was strongest for articles that appeared at the front of the 
journal, and should thus be more salient and more likely to be remembered.  There was 
no evidence of recency effects, or later items being more likely to be selected, and 
ancillary analyses cast doubt on alternative explanations for the effect.4   
These findings are particularly noteworthy given the seemingly objective nature 
of the choice domain studied.  Citations are often seen as an unbiased measure of 
scholarship, and used to determine everything from hiring to tenure.  Our results, 
however, indicate that the prominence research achieves can be shaped by the mere order 
in which articles happen to appear in the journal.  Readers browse through journals from 
the beginning and most journals include a sequentially listed table of contents.  As a 
result, psychological processes of attention and memory should lead earlier articles to be 
cited more.   
The results have important implications.  Given the high stakes associated with 
citations, everyone would benefit from greater awareness that they may reflect more than 
article quality.  Controlling for other potential factors, such as article order, may provide 
a more accurate picture of research contribution.  Similarly, if articles by more famous 
authors, or researchers from more prominent institutions, are more likely to appear first, 
this may partially explain why such articles receive more citations (Haslam et al., 2008; 
Helmreich, Spence, Beane, Lucker, & Matthews 1980).   From a journal management 
                                                 
4 Primacy effects may be particularly likely in low-motivation situations where people are not required to 
choose at the end of the sequence.  Recency effects should also be less likely in such situations, particularly 
when item lists are longer. 
Order Effects After Delay 15 
perspective, placing articles in order of acceptance, or randomly, may provide the fairest 
solution.   
In conclusion, these findings contribute to understanding how presentation order 
affects choice.  Most work in the area has looked at how serial position impacts 
immediate choice when participants are exposed to all the options and required to choose.  
Our findings, however, indicate that serial position has even broader effects.  Even when 
individuals are not required to choose, and choice occurs after delay, the mere order in 
which options happened to appear originally can impact choice. More broadly, if 
presentation order influences even seemingly objective domains like academic research, 
it should have even larger effects in areas where choice is more malleable.
