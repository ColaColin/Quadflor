ABSTRACT
We propose a portmanteau test for serial correlation of the error term in a fixed effects model. The
test is derived as a conditional Lagrange multiplier test, but it also has a straightforward Wald test
interpretation. In Monte Carlo experiments, the test displays good size and power properties.

A Portmanteau Test for Serially Correlated Errors in Fixed
Effects Models
I. Introduction
Empirical researchers frequently use longitudinal data to estimate fixed effects models of the form
yit = ci + ?
?xit + ?it, (1)
where i = 1, 2, ..., N indexes cross-sectional units (such as individuals, firms, states in a country, or
countries) and t = 1, 2, ..., T indexes time periods. In analyses of longitudinal microdata, T typically
is fairly small. The K explanatory variables in the xit vector are commonly assumed to be strictly
exogenous, while the ?fixed effect? ci is a time-invariant unit-specific effect that may be correlated
with elements of xit, but not with the error term ?it. If ?it is i.i.d. N(0, ?
2), the efficient estimator of
? is the ?fixed effects estimator? that applies ordinary least squares (OLS) to the mean-differenced
regression of yit ? y?i on xit ? x?i where y?i = ?Tt=1 yit/T and x?i = ?Tt=1 xit/T . An alternative way
of computing the same estimator is to apply OLS to the regression of yit on xit and a vector of
unit-specific dummy variables.
Often, however, the error term is not i.i.d., but instead is serially correlated. This occurs in
longitudinal data for the same reasons it frequently occurs in single time series - mainly because
of left-out variables that evolve gradually over time. Quite strangely, researchers who learned
in introductory econometrics always to check for serial correlation when estimating time series
regressions completely forget this lesson when estimating fixed effects regressions with multiple time
series. When Kezdi (2002) scoured three recent years? issues of the American Economic Review,
Journal of Political Economy, and Quarterly Journal of Economics, he found that, of the 42 articles
1
that estimated fixed effects models, 36 paid no attention whatsoever to the serial correlation issue.
Similarly, Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004), who focused on the ?differences in differences?
special case in which the explanatory variable of main interest is a binary policy variable, located
65 articles that appeared in the same journals plus three applied field journals over the 1990-2000
period, and they found that 60 of those 65 studies totally ignored serial correlation. The trouble with
this state of affairs is that ignoring serial correlation in the fixed effects context has the same poor
consequences that it has with a single time series: it leads to inconsistent estimation of standard
errors and hence to inappropriate hypothesis tests, and it also leads to inefficient estimation of the
regression coefficients.
We conjecture that practitioners? inattention to serial correlation in fixed effects models is partly
due to a lack of simple diagnostics. Therefore, in the next section, we present a straightforward
portmanteau statistic for testing the null hypothesis of no serial correlation against a general al-
ternative that at least some of the autocorrelations are nonzero.1 Our test can be applied in the
fixed effects context much as the Box-Pierce statistic is with a single time series. When our test
rejects the null hypothesis, as it often will, practitioners should proceed in the same three ways
that they do in the time series context. First, they should consider whether the error term?s se-
rial correlation is a symptom of model misspecification.2 Second, at a minimum, they should use
a robust covariance matrix estimator to correct their estimated standard errors (Arellano, 1987;
Kezdi, 2002). Third, they should consider attempting more efficient coefficient estimation through
1Existing tests for serial correlation in fixed effects models are discussed below in Section III.
2For example, Solon (1984a), upon finding large positive autocorrelations at low orders and large negative ones
at high orders, recognized that he needed to add state-specific time trends to his model. Note that an advantage of
our test relative to existing alternatives is that it gives attention to higher-order autocorrelations, which sometimes
may help with identifying specification problems.

a feasible generalized least squares procedure (Kiefer, 1980; Nickell, 1980; Bhargava, Franzini, and
Narendranathan, 1982; Solon, 1984b; Hansen, 2003).
II. A Portmanteau Test
We can rewrite the model in equation (1) in matrix notation as
yi = ci`T +Xi? + ?i, (2)
where `T is the T -dimensional column vector of ones, yi = [yi1 yi2 ? ? ? yiT ]?, Xi = [xi1 xi2 ? ? ? xiT ]?,
and ?i = [?i1 ?i2 ? ? ? ?iT ]?. Letting ? = E(?i??i), we wish to test the null hypothesis ? = ?2IT
against the alternative that at least some off-diagonal elements of ? are nonzero.3 To devise a
powerful test, we will start with a Lagrange multiplier (LM) approach under the assumption that
i is normally distributed. It will turn out, though, that the resulting test has a straightforward
Wald test interpretation even when ?i is nonnormal.
Because of the incidental parameters ci, one cannot construct an LM test based on the likelihood
function. Thus we construct a conditional likelihood function based on a sufficient statistic for the
individual specific effect ci (see Chamberlain, 1980, for this approach to the logit model for panel
data). When ? = ?2IT , the sufficient statistic is y?i. When ? 6= ?2IT , however, the sufficient
statistic is (`?T?
?1yi)/(`?T?
?1`T ). Then the conditional log-likelihood function is given by
lnL = ?N

3Like the existing tests for serial correlation in fixed effects models, the initial version of our test assumes ho-
moskedasticity. At the end of this section, we describe a modification of our test that allows the variance of ?it to
vary with t.

Because of the mean-differencing transformation, the estimated covariance matrix is singular
and is of rank T ? 1. Let ?k be the (T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2? 1 parameter vector obtained by stacking the
lower-diagonal elements of the (T ? 1)? (T ? 1) matrix that remains after deleting the kth column
and row of the covariance matrix ?. Under the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation, ?k is a vector
of zeros. Let Dk,T denote the T
2 ? (T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2 matrix such that Dk,T = ?vec(?)/?? ?k where
vec is the vec operator that transforms a matrix into a column vector by stacking the columns of
the matrix. When k = 2 and T = 3, for example,
Dk,T =

converges to a ?2 distribution with degrees of freedom (T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2 as N ??. Thus, our test
will be applicable in the typical panel data setting in which T may be small, but N is large.
To make the test operational we will proceed as follows: First, write the fixed effects estimator
?? as
?? = (

Theorem 1. Suppose that
(a) Xi, ?i are iid and have finite fourth moments.
(b) E(?i|Xi, ci) = 0.
(c) rank[E(X ?iMXi)] = dim(xit).
(d) T ? 3.

(e) D?k,TV Dk,T is nonsingular.
Then under the null hypothesis that ? = ?2IT , the LM test statistic is asymptotically distributed
(as N ??) as ?2((T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2).
Proof: Since the regressors Xi are strictly exogenous and ?? is
?
N consistent, it follows that

Since ?? and ??2 are consistent, it follows that
D?k,T V? Dk,T = D
?
k,TV Dk,T + op(1). (6)
Combining (5) and (6) we obtain the desired result.
Although we have motivated our test as an LM test, inspection of the test statistic reveals that it
also is a Wald statistic that checks whether the sample autocovariances of the fixed effects residuals
e?it are significantly different from their population counterparts under the null hypothesis. As
explained in Wooldridge (2002, pp. 270 and 274?275), autocovariances of the fixed effects residuals
consistently estimate those of eit = ?it? ??i, not ?it. As a result, under the null hypothesis that ?it is
serially uncorrelated, the sample autocovariances of e?it converge not to zero, but rather to ??2/T .
Our test ascertains whether the discrepancies between the sample autocovariances and ???2/T are
statistically significant. Equivalently, it tests whether the sample autocorrelations are significantly
different from ?1/(T ? 1).
Our test can be usefully modified in three ways. First, in certain circumstances, especially
when T is relatively large, it may be desirable to focus the test statistic on only the lower-order
6
autocovariances. Including all the autocovariances may lead to a loss of power analogous to that
from including too many orders of autocorrelation when the Box-Pierce test is used with a single
time series.
Second, the test is readily adapted to the case of unbalanced panel data in which some obser-
vations are randomly missing. Let si = [si1, ..., siT ]
? denote the T -dimensional column vector of
selection indicators: sit = 1 if xit and yit are observed and sit = 0 otherwise. Then with some abuse
of notation the modified LM statistic can be written as
LM = N?

Theorem 2. Suppose that
(a) Xi, ?i, si are iid and have finite fourth moments.
(b) E(?i|Xi, ci, si) = 0.
(c) rank[E(X ?iMiXi)] = dim(xit).

Then under the null hypothesis that E(?i?

ically distributed (as N ??) as ?2((T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2).
The proof of Theorem 2 is analogous to the proof of Theorem 1 and thus is omitted.
Third, the test can be modified to allow for time-varying variances. Using the fixed effects
residuals, estimate the possibly time-varying variances ?21, ..., ?

on moment conditions
E[D?Tvec(Weie

vi = [W ?W ? (W ?W )DT (D?TW ?WDT )?1D?T (W ?W )]vec(eie?i ?M?M).
(f) D?T (W ?W )DT is nonsingular.
Then under the null hypothesis that ? is a diagonal matrix, the approximate LM test statistic is
asymptotically distributed (as N ??) as ?2((T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2).
The proof of Theorem 3 is provided in the technical appendix. Because the fixed effects estimator
is not a maximum likelihood estimator in the presence of time-varying variances, the test statistic
is not the exact LM statistic. If one is to obtain the exact LM statistic, one needs to estimate the
fixed effects generalized least squares estimator by
??GLS = (

and iterate method of moments estimation of ?21, ..., ?

T and fixed effects GLS estimation until ??GLS
and ??21, ..., ??

T converge. Because the fixed effects estimator is consistent, however, the asymptotic
null distributions of the approximate and exact LM statistics are identical.
III. Monte Carlo Analyses
We have shown that, under the null hypothesis, our portmanteau test statistic converges to a
?2((T ? 1)(T ? 2)/2) distribution as N ? ?, but how applicable is that distribution when N is
large but finite? To explore that question, we have conducted a Monte Carlo study in which the
data generating process is equation (1) with ? = 0, scalar xit ? i.i.d.N(0, 1), ?it ? i.i.d.N(0, 1).
The sample sizes considered are N = 50, 100, 250, 500 and T = 5, 8. The number of Monte Carlo
replications is set to 10000, and the deleted time period in the test statistic is k = 1.
9
Table 1 reports the actual rejection frequencies when the nominal size is 5%. In the experiments
with T = 5, the empirical sizes come quite close to the nominal size. With T = 8, there are some
mild size distortions at smaller N . These distortions mostly disappear by the time N reaches 500.
We also have conducted a series of Monte Carlo analyses to investigate the power of our test
and compare it to the power of several other tests. Unlike our portmanteau test, most existing
tests focus on the specific alternative of nonzero first-order autocorelation. For example, Bhargava,
Franzini, and Narendranathan (1982), assuming normality of the error term, have developed a
Durbin-Watson test against the alternative that the error term follows a first-order autoregression.4
Wooldridge (2002, p. 275) has suggested applying OLS to the first-order autoregression of e?it and
then performing a t-test of the hypothesis that the autoregressive coefficient equals ?1/(T ? 1).
He emphasized that the standard error estimate in the denominator of the t-ratio must be robust
to serial correlation. Another test, hinted at by Wooldridge (2002, pp. 282?283) and developed by
Drukker (2003), is based on the residuals from OLS estimation of the first difference of equation
(1). This test applies OLS to the first-order autoregression of the residuals and then performs a
t-test of the hypothesis that the autoregressive coefficient equals ?1/2. Again, the standard error
estimate must be robust to serial correlation. Finally, Kezdi (2002) has proposed a White-type test
that checks whether a covariance matrix estimate robust to serial correlation differs significantly
from the conventional covariance matrix estimate that assumes no serial correlation.
The Monte Carlo analyses summarized in Table 2 compare the performance of all these tests in
experiments with T = 8, N = 500, and 10000 replications. The four rows of the table correspond to
experiments with four different data generating processes. The first (DGP1) is the same as in Table
4Baltagi and Wu (1999) have proposed a related test. Hansen?s (2003) analysis emphasizes feasible generalized
least squares estimation, but his methods can be used to formulate a test against the alternative of a pth-order
autoregression.
10
1: the null hypothesis case of no serial correlation. In the second (DGP2), the error term ?it follows
a first-order autoregression with autoregressive parameter 0.4. In the third (DGP3), ?it follows a
second-order moving average process with first-order parameter 0.375 and second-order parameter
0.6. With these parameter values, the first- and second-order autocorrelations equal each other and
are approximately 0.4. In each of these three data generating processes, V ar(?it) = 1. In the fourth
(DGP4), ?it follows the nonstationary process
?it = vit + ?it
where vit and ?i are i.i.d. normal with zero mean, Var(vit) = 0.5, and Var(?i) = 0.02. This ex-
periment represents the situation in which misspecification of the fixed effects model (namely, the
omission of the individual-specific linear time trends) may or may not be detected by serial cor-
relation diagnostics.5 The possibility of detection arises because the fixed effects residuals will be
positively autocorrelated at low orders, negatively autocorrelated at high orders, and heteroskedas-
tic.
Two general results from Table 2 are worth noting at the outset. First, as shown in the first
row, all the tests display an empirical size reasonably close to the nominal size of 0.05. Second,
as shown in the last column, the Kezdi test has no power against any of the departures from
the null hypothesis. This is by design: the regressor in our experiments is i.i.d. As a result,
the conventional covariance matrix estimator remains consistent despite serial correlation (and, in
DGP4, heteroskedasticity) of the error term. Kezdi?s test, which compares conventional and robust
covariance matrix estimates, discovers no problem. If consistency of standard error estimation were
the only concern, this would be a good outcome. As noted in Section I, however, there are two
5See Solon (1984a), Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan (1993), Friedberg (1998), and Donohue and Levitt (2001)
for examples of longitudinal analyses involving individual- or state-specific time trends.
11
other motives for serial correlation diagnostics: (1) to detect model misspecification and (2) to check
whether more efficient estimation may be possible through feasible generalized least squares. Our
experiments highlight the point that Kezdi?s test sometimes lacks power for these purposes.
The other lessons from Table 2 are specific to the particular data generating processes. Under
DGP2, the serial correlation of the error term is most pronounced at the first order. Because all of
the tests other than Kezdi?s are sensitive to this type of serial correlation, all of them show good
power.
Under DGP3, the first- and second-order autocorrelations both are around 0.4. Most of the tests
still are powerful, but not the Wooldridge-Drukker test based on the residuals from first-difference
estimation. That test checks an implication of the null hypothesis that the first-differenced error
term has a first-order autocorrelation of ?1/2. The trouble is that the same implication applies
to any process for ?it in which the first- and second-order autocorrelations are the same (but not
necessarily zero). By design, the MA(2) process in DGP3 has that property, so the Wooldridge-
Drukker test has no power in this case. The more general lesson is that the Wooldridge-Drukker
test will lack power for detecting serial correlation of ?it whenever the first- and second-order
autocorrelations are similar.
Under DGP4, an important manifestation of the fixed effects model?s misspecification is negative
higher-order autocorrelations of the residuals. As a result, our portmanteau test tends to show
much better power than tests focused on first-order autocorrelation. The reason that our own
test specialized to first-order autocovariances is also relatively powerful is that it is sensitive to
the heteroskedasticity that causes the first-order autocovariances from different time periods to
differ from each other. This is true to varying but lesser degrees for the other tests, which also
assume homoskedasticity. If one wishes to use a test sensitive only to serial correlation and not to
12
heteroskedasticity, one may use the variant of our test described at the end of Section II.
Although our own tests perform well in all of these experiments, it is obvious that our port-
manteau test will be suboptimal in certain circumstances. For example, when serial correlation
is most pronounced at the first order and T is sufficiently large, the portmanteau test that uses
all autocovariances must surely be less powerful than a test focused on first-order autocorrelation.
Our recommendation to practitioners is to use both a portmanteau test and a test for first-order
autocorrelation. We are convinced that following this advice would be a major improvement over
the typical current practice of ignoring serial correlation altogether.

Proof of Theorem 3: Because the fixed effects estimator is N1/2-consistent even when the variances

the moment condition (7) is the first order condition for the maximum likelihood estimator, the
minimum distance estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. It follows from Theorem 2
