Labor Market Pooling, Outsourcing and Contracts in
Chamberlinian Regions∗

Abstract
Economic regions, such as urban agglomerations, face external demand and price
shocks that produce income risk. Workers in large and diversiÞed agglomerations
may beneÞt from reduced wage volatility, while Þrms may outsource the production
of intermediate goods and realize beneÞts from Chamberlinian externalities. Firms
may also protect workers from wage risks through Þxed wage contracts. This paper
explores the relationships between Þrms risks, workers contracts, and the structure
of production in cities.
Keywords: Labor market, Labor contracts, Chamberlinian Externalities.

1 Introduction
As recognized long ago by Arrow and Debreu, eﬃcient resource allocation in a world
of uncertainty requires a complete set of markets within which risks can pooled and
traded. With incomplete markets, risks may fall on agents for whom risk-bearing is costly.
Economic institutions  not just Þnancial institutions like banks and insurance companies,
but all Þrms, and all contractual relationships  transmit and distribute fundamental risks.
These institutional structures adapt over time to the changing fundamental structure of
the economy. In this paper, we explore the transmission, pooling, relationships between
industry structure, labor market contracting, and earnings risk using a model of an urban
agglomeration or other spatially-integrated economic region. Industries within this region,
which export products to the rest of the economy, face stochastic demands for their
products, producing output and income shocks that aﬀect the region. We investigate the
simultaneous determination of industrial structure, of employment relationships, and of
earnings risk, under varying assumptions about the ability of Þrms (or workers) to access
Þnancial markets within which risks can be traded.
More speciÞcally, as in Ethier (1982), assume a set of Þrms in an urban area or
economic region operate under conditions of increasing returns to scale. These Þrms 
henceforth called manufacturing Þrms, for convenience  produce tradeable goods, us-
ing non-traded intermediate goods and services called components. These intermediate
commodities may be produced within the manufacturing Þrms themselves (a vertically-
integrated industrial structure) or by specialized component producers (outsourcing).
Stochastic demand for traded goods implies that manufacturing outputs, prices, and
proÞts are also random, as are derived demands for intermediate and primary inputs.
In particular, external demand shocks may result in stochastic ßuctuations in the wages
received by risk-averse workers  depending on the nature of labor contracting, and in
particular, on whether workers are hired at Þxed wages in advance of the realization of
external demand shocks or are instead hired (and Þred) at wages that depend on these
2
realizations. The equilibrium structure of Þrms and of employment contracts simultane-
ously determine the ultimate distribution of income risks among Þrms and workers within
the region.
As will become apparent, a wide range of equilibrium conÞgurations is possible, de-
pending on the underlying fundamental economic data of the regional economy. The
analysis begins, in Section 2, with the speciÞcation of a basic model of regional produc-
tion and employment reßecting indivisibilities at the level of export Þrms and increasing
returns in the production of intermediate components as well. Section 3 proceeds under
the assumption that employers cannot in any way contract with workers in advance of the
realization of demand shocks and shows that equilibria can emerge with fully integrated
manufacturing Þrms, manufacturing Þrms that outsource all production of components,
or a mix of the two, depending on the number of manufacturing Þrms in the region. The
extent of wage income risk faced by workers in equilibrium also depends on the number of
manufacturing Þrms and on the degree of diversiÞcation of the regions industrial struc-
ture. Section 4 allows for the possibility that Þrms may be able to absorb some of the
income risk otherwise borne by workers by contracting with them ex ante. Such contracts
impose costs on Þrms, in part by limiting their ability to adapt employment to realized
demand. Whether such contracts are found in equilibrium depends on tradeoﬀs between
these costs and their beneÞts to risk-averse workers: a range of equilibrium conÞgurations
is possible.
Although the model is, of necessity, highly stylized, it oﬀers insights into the ways
that industrial structure and the distribution of earnings, proÞt, and employment risk are
simultaneously determined. We do not attempt to link the analysis closely to empirical
Þndings on urban and regional production, employment, earnings, and proÞts, but note
that diﬀerent economic regions, in diﬀerent parts of the world and at diﬀerent historical
periods, could fruitfully be compared using the structural determinants identiÞed below.
For example, the process of urbanization and industrialization in advanced and developing
3
countries is often accompanied by increases in the number and diversity of major export-
oriented industries and by the development of Þnancial markets within which the proÞt
risks facing Þrm owners can be pooled, both of which, our analysis suggests, can aﬀect
the equilibrium degree of vertical integration and of labor contracting.
Related literature: A number of previous contributions highlight the importance of
thick labor markets skills, qualiÞcation or training (see Helsley and Strange, 1990;
Brueckner, Thisse and Zenou, 2002; or Hamilton and Thisse 2000). Picard and Toule-
monde (2004) show that Þrms and workers can increase the chance of good job matches
in large regions; Ellison and Fudenberg (2003) explore this issue with integer numbers
of Þrms. In Krugman (1991, Appendix) Þrms are uncertain about their costs and tend
agglomerate to reduce wage variability and the risk premium paid to workers. Using a
similar model but with no endogenous agglomeration, Wildasin (1995) examines the im-
plications of integrated or pooled labor markets for the distribution of income risk and
for the beneÞts and costs of tax/transfer policies that protect against such risks. These
analyses ignore the possibility, explored in Section 4 below, that Þrms may explicitly or
implicitly (Baily (1974), Azariadis (1975), Rosen (1985)) insure workers against earnings
risk.
The analysis extends previous research on diversity and specialization. Abdel-Rahman
and Fujita (1993) analyze specialized cities (with a single industry) versus diversiÞed
cities (with two industries). Duranton and Puga (2001) discuss the migration process of
Þrms from diversiÞed Chamberlinian regions to specialized factory towns. Many recent
studies of economic geography postulate the existence of Chamberlinian regions where
Þnal good producers outsource production of intermediate goods to small, diversiÞed,
monopolistically competitive Þrms (see for instance Venables 1996) but take city structure
as exogenous in the sense that downstream Þrms never integrate vertically to incorporate
upstream production. As shown in Section 3, vertically integrated industries may but
need not always arise when industry structure is determined endogenously.

2 The model
Production structure. We model a region with a predetermined number M of Þrms, each
of which is the sole producer of a commodity that is sold on external markets. These Þrms
form the economic base of the region (Tiebout (1962)). Each Þrm j, j = 1, . . .M , faces
a demand for its product given by Yj = θjP
−ε
j , where Pj is the price of the commodity,
ε > 1 is the price elasticity of demand, and θj ∈ [θ, θ], 0 < θ < θ < ∞, is a Þrm-
speciÞc random variable that reßects demand shocks on external markets. Variations in
θj may result from ßuctuations in incomes, preferences, technologies, and prices of related
goods in the rest of the world. With little loss of generality, we assume that E(θj) =
1 ∀j, and thus the variance and covariance of these shocks are var[θj] = E (θj − 1)2
and cov[θj , θk]j 6=k = E (θj − 1) (θk − 1). In some instances, we assume that these random
shocks are i.i.d., but we also allow for them to be correlated, including the possibility
that they are perfectly correlated. A low degree of correlation of these shocks can be
interpreted as a situation where the regions economic base is highly diversiÞed, and,
as we shall see, this sometimes allows for important pooling of risks; this is not possible
when the demand shocks are perfectly correlated. We let θ ≡ (θ1, . . . , θM) denote the
vector of random shocks.
Each of the M Þrms uses various components in the production process; for ease of
reference, we henceforth refer to each of these Þrms as a manufacturing Þrm. As in
Ethier (1982), we can think of the production activities of these Þrms as an assembly
process in which components are combined to yield a Þnal product, according to a CES
production function Yj = [
R Nj
0
xj(i)
ρdi]1/ρ, where xj(i) is the quantity of component i in
the Þnal product j; here, ρ < 1 and the elasticity of substitution between components is
1/(1− ρ). 1 Nj represents the total range of components used by Þrm j. The production
of each component requires lj(i) = a + bxj(i) units of labor, where a > 0 and b > 0 are
1At the cost of notational complexity, it would be possible to incorporate other inputs in the production
process, but this would not aﬀect the results of the analysis in any important way.

parameters that represent Þxed and variable input requirements; components are thus
produced under conditions of increasing returns to scale. Letting wj denote the wage rate
paid by Þrm j, the production of components thus costs cj(i) = (a+ bxj(i))wj .
In order to insure that each Þrms proÞt and output is bounded, we assume that
δ ≡ ρ− 1 + 1/ε > 0.
This implies that ρ > 0 (components are substitutes). Note that δ < ρ and δ < ρ/ε < 1/ε.
While the manufacturing Þrms are the locus of assembly activities, they can produce
components internally, in which case we refer to them as integrated manufacturers, or
they may obtain components from specialized local component producers, in which case
we refer to them as outsourcing manufacturers. The local component producers utilize
the same increasing-returns production technologies as are available to the manufacturing
Þrms. In this case, we obtain an industrial structure characterized by Chamberlinian mo-
nopolistic competition in the components sector of the regions economy. One goal of the
analysis is to determine endogenously which of these two structures emerges in equilib-
rium. For the sake of analytical tractability, we assume that outsourcing manufacturers
outsource the full production of components.
Workers. There is a Þxed stock L of identical workers in the region, each supplying
a single unit of labor. Each workers utility is a concave function of the wage w; in some
cases, we focus on the constant-elasticity form u(w) = wα/α for α ≤ 1. (wα/α reduces to
ln(w) when α = 0.) In this case, the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion is 1− α.
Labor Markets. We assume that whereas Þrms have market power in the product and
component markets, Þrms and workers are price and (expected) utility takers in the labor
market. This price-taking condition naturally holds when the number of Þrms is large.
When the number of Þrms is small, we keep this assumption for the sake of consistency
and tractability.
6
We allow for two possible types of employment relationships. In the Þrst, Þrms hire
workers ex post (i.e., subsequent to the realization of demand shocks) in single competitive
market at a wage rate of w. In the second, Þrms may contract with workers ex ante to
supply their labor at a Þxed (non-state-contingent) wage w0. For the sake of analytical
tractability, we assume that contracts are exclusive and non-renegotiable: on the one
hand, Þrms are not allowed to hire additional workers ex post, to Þre contracted workers,
or to reduce the contracted wage payment; on the other hand, contracted workers are
obliged to oﬀer their labor, cannot quit the Þrm or renegotiate higher wages. In contrast
to Scho¨b and Wildasin (2002), wage contracts not only impose constraints on labor price
but also on the size of a contracting Þrm. Also, in contrast to Duranton and Combes
(2001) a Þrm is not allowed to poach workers from other Þrms by oﬀering higher ex
post wages.2 In Section 3, we restrict attention to the case where hiring only occurs ex
post ; later, we allow for ex ante contracting and for the endogenous determination of
contracting form.
3 Chamberlinian Externalities
To understand the incentives to outsource, we compare the proÞts of manufacturing Þrms
under integration and under outsourcing.
3.1 Integrated Manufacturers
Let M and M denote the set and the number of manufacturing Þrms and let MI and
MI denote the set and the number of integrated manufacturing Þrms. Each Þrm j ∈MI
chooses the number of components, hires workers in a perfectly competitive labor market,
sets its product price and, Þnally, supplies its product market.
2BeneÞts from larger component variety in cities are not considered in Scho¨b and Wildasin (2002) and
Combes and Duranton (2001).
7
By symmetry, Þrm j produces identical quantities of components: xj(i) ≡ xj for all
i. The production function then simpliÞes to Yj = xjN
1/ρ
j and the Þrms production cost
is (aNj + bYjN

ρ
j )w, a convex function of Nj. For any desired level of output Yj, the
cost-minimizing numbers of each components and of component varieties are given by
xj = x ≡ a

Note that changes in output aﬀect only the number of varieties of components, not the
amount of each that is used. The optimal labor requirement and the indirect cost function

Cost is a sub-additive function of output. Economies of scope are internalized in the
integrated Þrm so that average costs decrease with output and are larger than marginal
cost. Furthermore, both marginal and average costs decrease with output at the (negative)
rate ρ−1 while inverse demand and marginal revenue functions decrease at the (negative)
rate −1/ε. Under the assumption δ ≡ ρ− 1 + 1/ε > 0, interior solutions exist and yield

where ρδ > 1. When wages rise, the equilibrium output Yj decreases. When the Þrm faces
a positive demand shock (i.e., a high value of θj), it increases its output and decreases its
product price. Since the rise in output reduces the average Þxed cost of a component, the
8
Þrm is therefore able to increase the number of components. In turn, a larger variety of
components raises production eﬃciency, which decreases marginal cost and price. Finally,
proÞt decreases with wages.

This is an increasing and jointly convex function of θ because δε < ρ.
We now turn to the analysis of the manufacturing Þrms that choose to outsource
production to the local component producers.
3.2 Outsourcing Firms
Let Mo and Mo denote the set and number of outsourcing manufacturers. These Þrms
outsource their production of all components to a set of Chamberlinian Þrms, each pro-
ducing a single component variety. Outsourcing manufacturers are then just assembly
line Þrms that use components produced by others in the region.
The component sector is subject to Chamberlinian monopolistic competition. Each
component maker i ∈ N produces a single component and sets a proÞt-maximizing price
p(i), conditional on the realization of all demand shocks for outsourcing manufacturers.
Under Chamberlinian monopolistic competition, manufacturers are price takers in the
component market. Yet free entry impedes component makers to set to high prices.
Under free entry component producers proÞts fall to zero and the number of component
producers reaches its equilibrium value N .
9
The demand for a component is given by the sum of the outsourcing manufacturers
demands. Each outsourcing Þrm maximizes its proÞt YjPj −

Manufacturing Þrms proÞts can be written as function of product prices and com-
ponent price index as Πj = (Pj − p)Yj . The production and proÞt of each outsourcing

is a measure of the average demand shock realized by the outsourcing manufacturers.
The supply of components is derived as follows. Each component producer i manufac-
tures a single variety of component and hires workers in the labor market, where it is price
taker. It thus maximizes p(i)x(i) − (a+ bx(i))w, treating the wage and the price index
p as constants. Because of iso-elastic demand, the optimal price is a constant markup
10
on marginal cost equal to p(i) = bw/ρ. Furthermore, free entry requires that proÞts of
component producers are equal to zero. This implies that x(i) = (a/b)(ρ/(1 − ρ)) = x.
Note that the optimal level of component production turns out to be equal to that chosen
by integrated Þrms.3

It is interesting to observe the impact of shocks on manufacturers proÞts under integration
and outsourcing. Suppose that w and Ψo are constant, which approximates a situation
where the region includes many Þrms with independent shocks and where the set of
outsourcing manufacturers is large enough. Then, we note that the proÞt of an outsourcing
manufacturer j is linear in its own shock θj whereas it is an increasing and convex function
of its own shock under integration. Hence, expected proÞts do not depend on shock
variances under outsourcing whereas they rise with mean preserving increases of variance
under integration. Manufacturers are then more likely to prefer to integration when they
face large uncertainties. The latter conÞguration indeed oﬀers better production ßexibility.
For instance, in the case of high demand shocks, Þrms can take beneÞt of larger economies
of scope as they are able to increase their number of components.
3This is a standard result of CES functions; Dixit and Stiglitz (1977) show, for CES preferences, that
equilibrium production is equal to the Þrst best production.

3.3 Labor Market
A region can include integrated and outsourcing manufacturing Þrms. Integrated man-
ufacturing Þrms compete for labor with component producers. Both types of Þrms are
price takers in the labor market. Labor market clearing condition requires that
L = LI (w,MI ,ΨI) +No(w,Mo,Ψo)(a+ bx)
from which it follows that the equilibrium wage satisÞesµ

3.4 The Deterministic Case
It is instructive to consider Þrst the special case of the model where all demand uncertainty
disappears (θj = 1 ∀j). What determines whether manufacturers choose to be integrated
or to outsource?
We say that the set of manufacturing Þrms are in an equilibrium conÞguration when
no Þrm can proÞtably switch its own organization of production, given the organiza-
tional conÞguration of all other manufacturers. Because of the assumption that Þrms act
competitively in the labor market, none believe that their choices of integration versus
outsourcing have an impact on wages. For any given wage w, the ratio of proÞts under
each conÞguration is equal to
Πoj
ΠIj

MocM
¶ 1−ρ
δ

ε
where cM ≡ ³δερ−ρδ ´ δ1−ρ εε−1 (10)
It is apparent that cM is a critical value that determines manufacturers incentives to
outsource production.4 Low values of cM favor outsourcing decisions while high values
favor integration. The nature of equilibrium however depends on the value of cM and on
4The expression of cM is transcendental. It can nevertheless be shown numerically that cM > 1 for all
admissible values of ρ ∈ (0, 1) and ε > 1 such that δ > 0 and that cM is a decreasing function of ε and ρ.
12
how the latter compares to the number Mo of Þrms that outsource. For instance whencM < 1, all Þrms outsource at the equilibrium because Πoj/ΠIj > 1 for any Mo ≥ 1. So,
any individual manufacturer evaluates (given other manufacturers conÞgurations) that
it makes more proÞt if at least one Þrm outsources. This entices that manufacturer to
become the Þrst outsourcing Þrm. All other Þrms then make the same outsourcing deci-
sion whatever the (non zero) number of outsourcing manufacturers in the labor market.
Similarly, when cM > M − 1, all Þrms integrate at the equilibrium because Πoj/ΠIj < 1
for any Mo ≤ M − 1. Manufacturers indeed make more proÞt if one of them integrates,
which entices each of them to integrate. For intermediate values of cM , (1 ≤ cM ≤M −1),
the above argument breaks because manufacturers do not make more proÞt neither if one
of them integrates nor if one of them outsources. There must be more than one Þrm
choose the same structure to entice the others to make the same decision. As shown in
the following Proposition we may encounter multiple equilibria.
Proposition 1 Consider a region of M manufacturing Þrms with identical deterministic
demands.
(i) If cM < 1, then all Þrms choose to outsource.
(ii) If 1 ≤ cM ≤M − 1, then all Þrms choose to integrate.
(iii) If cM > M − 1 and cM ≥ 1 then there are two equilibrium conÞgurations: either all
manufacturers will be integrated, or all will outsource.
This proposition shows that multiple equilibria are possible (see also McLaren (2000)).
In particular, it is possible to have an equilibrium with integrated Þrms in which each
Þrm could increase its proÞts if it and all other Þrms would simultaneously switch to
the alternative conÞguration. Firms thus face a coordination problem. For the sake
of simplicity, we assume henceforth that some institutional structure exists (perhaps city
planning, zoning, or collusion) that results in the more proÞtable conÞguration to emerge,
whenever multiple equilibria are possible.
13
3.5 The Stochastic Case
Let us now reintroduce demand uncertainty into the model. We shall assume that Þrms
must choose their organizational form prior to the realization of demand shocks. In this
uncertain environment, the ex post wage is also stochastic, as shown in equation (9).
We assume throughout that manufacturing Þrms are risk neutral, that is, they seek to
maximize expected proÞts. The assumption of risk neutrality for these Þrms rests on a
presumption that they have access to Þnancial markets (e.g., equities markets) or are part
of larger diversiÞed corporations external to the region, such that their proÞt risks are
eﬀectively shared at no cost.
We say that the set of manufacturing Þrms are in an equilibrium conÞguration when
no Þrm can increase its expected proÞts by switching its own organization of production,
given the organizational conÞguration of all other manufacturers. As before, none believe
that their choices of integration versus outsourcing have an impact on ex post wages. The
ratio of expected proÞts under each conÞguration is given by

As in the deterministic case, the incentive for a Þrm j to choose integration or outsourcing
depends on the number of outsourcing Þrms Mo, but now it also depends on the nature of
its own demand shocks and the correlation of those shocks with the ex post wage. Again,
the incentive to outsource is high when suﬃciently many other Þrms do so (Mo large).
The impact of shocks is embedded in the function Gj(Mo,MI) that depends on the
sets of Þrms that outsource and integrate component production. In its general form,
this function depends on the way manufacturers are partitioned between outsourcing and
integrated structures. When there are no shocks θj = 1 ∀j, this function is equal to 1
and Proposition 1 obviously applies. It also equal to 1 applies when shocks are symmetric
14
and perfectly correlated θj = θ0 ∀j. When shocks are small (i.e., variance of θj is small
compared to its mean value 1), the function remains close to 1 and Proposition 1 applies
to the stochastic case, to a Þrst order approximation.
As an important special case, Þrms whose demand shocks are identically distributed
are ex ante symmetric and the identity of the Þrms that outsource or integrate is thus
irrelevant. The function Gj(Mo,MI) becomes a function G(Mo) that depends only on
the number Mo of outsourcing Þrms. If the function
³
Mo/cM´ 1−ρδ ε−1ε G(Mo) increases in
Mo, the argument of Proposition 1 applies but with a new threshold cM1. By Proposition
1, at least with small risks, multiple equilibria may occur where all Þrms either integrate
or outsource; again, we postulate a coordination institution (city planning, zoning, or
collusion) that selects the most proÞtable conÞguration among multiple equilibria.
When Þrms risks are not identically distributed, Chamberlinian externalities dominate
for small and large numbers of Þrms as in the preceding paragraphs. As before, there may
exist multiple equilibrium conÞgurations for intermediate numbers of Þrms. Still, there are
two important diﬀerences with the previous analysis. First, because Þrms are not ex ante
symmetric, they may take diﬀerent decisions with respect to their structures. For instance,
Þrms facing high demand uncertainty may always prefer to integrate production because
this conÞguration oﬀers better production ßexibility. An equilibrium conÞguration may
then include a mix of integrated and outsourcing Þrms. Second, in the absence of ex
ante symmetry, Þrm get diﬀerent ex ante proÞts and may not agree on an equilibrium
conÞguration.
In the sequel we solve the issue of multiplicity of equilibrium by assuming that the exis-
tence of coordinating institutions. Such institutions select the most proÞtable equilibrium
conÞguration and facilitate (negotiated) agreements on possible surplus splits. Under
this assumption, the equilibrium is unique. Moreover, one may readily conjecture that all
manufacturers integrate in a region with few Þrms because of the lack of Chamberlinian
externalities. By contrast, manufacturers will outsource in a region with numerous Þrms
15
because of intense Chamberlinian externalities. In regions with intermediate numbers of
manufacturers, outsourcing may be the choice of a subset of manufacturers.
To conclude this section, note that the equilibrium wage is, in general, dependent on
the realizations of the demand for the manufacturing Þrms in the region, which means that
workers face wage risk. This is true, of course, when workers are employed by integrated
manufacturing Þrms, since these Þrms face stochastic demand for their products. It is also
true when workers are employed by component-producing Þrms because demand shocks
in external markets are transmitted through the manufacturing Þrms to the upstream
component producers.
Under either type of industrial structure, the magnitude of wage risk depends on the
number of manufacturing Þrms in the region M and on the joint distribution of their
demand shocks. In particular, if M is large and the demand shocks are uncorrelated (the
case where the θj s are i.i.d.), the variance of the equilibrium wage will be small: the
high demand for labor by Þrms with high levels of output demand will oﬀset the low
demand for labor with low demand realizations, so that the total demand for labor is
relatively stable. This corresponds to a diversiÞed industrial structure for the region.
If M is relatively small, however, or if external demand shocks are highly correlated, then
demand for labor will vary signiÞcantly across states of nature, as will the equilibrium
wage; in this case, wage risk will be high. Correlated risks may arise when the regions
economic base is highly specialized around just a few types of exported commodities
(the automobile industry in Detroit provides one illustration). Since demand on external
markets may depend on aggregate economic conditions (the economy-wide business cycle,
for instance), the case of correlated risks can also arise when there are many diﬀerent types
of Þrms in the regions economic base.
If workers are indiﬀerent to risk, then the fact that wages vary stochastically in re-
sponse to ßuctuations in external demand is, for them, a matter of no consequence. In
practice, however, households are risk averse, and wage risk can be very costly to them.
16
This means that workers would value employment relationships that provide some form of
insurance against wage ßuctuations. We therefore turn to an analysis of such contracting
arrangements.
4 Ex Ante Labor Contracting
In order for workers to be protected from wage risk, they must either be able to obtain
insurance that oﬀers state-contingent payments based on wage realizations, or they must
be able to contract for wages before the state of nature is known. Because of well-known
issues relating to transactions costs and moral hazard, we assume that workers are unable
to purchase earnings insurance individually. This means that the only opportunity to
obtain protection against wage risk must come from labor contracts. In the spirit of the
theory of implicit contracts (see Baily (1974), Gordon (1974), Azariadis (1975)), when
Þrms are risk neutral, they can provide insurance to workers by oﬀering labor contracts
in which wages and employment are Þxed ex ante. There are of course many alternative
models of labor contracting, but we focus for simplicity on contracts that are exclusive
and non-renegotiable. Our principal goal is to highlight the possible relationships between
contracts and the industrial structure of a region.
The previous section shows us that manufacturing can undertaken by integrated Þrms,
outsourcing Þrms or mixes of both conÞgurations. We here examine labor contracting by
Þrms in each structure, starting with integrated manufacturers, discussing then the case
of outsourcing Þrms and Þnally studying mixes of structures. Throughout this section,
we continue to assume that manufacturing Þrms have access to Þnancial markets or are
otherwise suﬃciently diversiÞed that they are indiﬀerent to risk.
17
4.1 Labor Contracting By Integrated Manufacturers
Suppose again that L workers and M manufacturing Þrms have settled in a region and
suppose that MI > 0 Þrms have chosen to integrate. Consider an integrated manufactur-
ing Þrm j ∈MI . We Þrst determine the properties of its wage contract and then compare
the expected proÞts of this Þrm with and without such contracts. Firms can potentially
hire workers ex post, in which case Þrms pay workers the stochastic equilibrium wage as
described previously. Alternatively, they can oﬀer ex ante contracts with a Þxed wage.
Firms and workers are assumed to act as price-takers both in the ex ante and ex post
labor markets. This means that no Þrm can pay a wage lower than the prevailing wage in
the ex ante market, w0, or in the ex post market, w. Equilibrium is attained when labor
demand is equal to labor supply both ex ante and ex post.
LetM0I andM 0I denote the set and the number of integrated manufacturers that choose
to hire ex ante, and let L0I denote the amount of labor that they employ. There are thus
MI −M 0I Þrms that hire the remaining L−L0I workers at a wage rate of w, subsequent to
the realization of demand shocks. There are three possible types of equilibrium: one in
which all manufacturers hire in the ex ante market (M 0I = MI), one in which none hire
in the ex ante market (M 0I = 0), and one in which some hire in both (0 < M
0
I < MI). If
u(w0) < Eu(w), L0I must be zero because all workers prefer ex post employment, whereas
L0I = L if u(w
0) > Eu(w). Thus, to determine which type of equilibrium emerges, we
need only to compare the expected proÞts of integrated Þrms when u(w0) = Eu(w).
Suppose that Þrm j oﬀers an ex ante contract with a wage w0 and chooses its pro-
duction level to maximize EΠj = E (θj)

Observe from this condition that the incentive to hire ex ante depends on the set of Þrms
that are active in the ex post labor market MI\M0I and Mo, but it is independent of
the size of the ex post labor market (as measured by L
0
I). An integrated Þrm j does
not oﬀer ex ante contracts iﬀ Fj is below one. Thus, an equilibrium occurs when the
integrated manufacturers can be partitioned in such a way that Fj(MI\M0I ,Mo) <
1 for all j ∈ MI\M0I and Fj(MI\M0I ,Mo) ≥ 1 for all j ∈ M0I . There need not
be a unique equilibrium since several partitions of integrated Þrms may satisfy these
equilibrium conditions.
Obviously, at a given conÞguration (MI\M0I ,Mo), a decrease in workers risk aversion
(larger α) increases workers certainty equivalent of wages (Ewα) /α which reduces Fj and
reduces the proÞtability of an ex ante contract. When workers are risk-neutral (α = 1),
the ratio Fj is below 1 provided that Þrm js shocks are not correlated too much with

algebraic rearrangement in the denominator and where the last line uses the deÞnition
of covariance for variables with means equal to one. When Þrm js shocks are negatively
correlated or completely uncorrelated with wages, the covariance in the last line is non-
negative and the ratio is below 1. In this case, Þrm j does not oﬀer ex ante contracts:
ex ante contracting constrains the ability of the Þrm to adjust output and employment
in response to demand shocks, a cost that is not oﬀset by the willingness of workers to
accept a lower wage ex ante.
Some region conÞgurations are easy to characterize. First, if the number of manufac-
turing Þrms is large and demand shocks are i.i.d., the ex post wage w is almost constant.
We get Fj < 1 because E(θ

Second, if all Þrms have perfectly correlated demand shocks, so that θj = θ0 for all j,
where θ0 is a common demand shock, then the ex post wage w becomes proportional to θ

oﬀer ex ante contracts. The case of a single integrated Þrm may be viewed as a particular
instance of the case of perfectly correlated shocks. Hence, we should expect to see ex
ante labor contracting in factory towns.5 Note that when workers are risk neutral (i.e.,
5Of course the assumption of price-taking behavior is not really justiÞable in the case of a sole manu-
20
α = 1) and risks are perfectly correlated, Þrms are indiﬀerent between hiring ex ante or
ex post : on the on hand, workers place no value on wage stability, and, on the other hand,
Þrms gain nothing from ex post employment ßexibility. To summarize:
Proposition 2 (i) In diversiÞed regions with many manufacturers, Þrms do not contract
with workers ex ante.
(ii) If manufacturers have perfectly correlated demand shocks, they do contract with
workers ex ante, providing workers with actuarially fair insurance (w0 = Ew).
(iii) When manufacturers face demand shocks that are partially correlated, equilibria
are possible in which Þrms with demand shocks that are highly positively correlated with
ex post wages contract for labor ex ante, while Þrms with demand shocks that are highly
negatively correlated with ex post wages contract for labor ex post.
More intuition can be obtained if we study the case of small demand uncertainty (i.e.,
variance of θj is small compared to its mean value 1).
Small risks. For small demand uncertainty (see Appendix), we can compute that

This formula conÞrms the two previous results: Þrms do not oﬀer ex ante labor con-
tracts when there are many Þrms and wages are almost non-stochastic, whereas they do
oﬀer such contracts when shocks are highly positively correlated. Furthermore, if workers
are suﬃciently risk averse, α is very negative and the inequality is not satisÞed, which is
to say that ex ante contracting dominates in this case.
This formula also shows how ex ante and ex post employment contracts can co-exist:
a Þrm is more likely to hire ex ante if its demand shock has low variance or if it is
facturing Þrm, but this result emphasizes the importance of lack of risk diversiÞcation as the underlying
reason for ex ante labor contracting in this model.
21
positively correlated with the ex post wage. Indeed, if it has low variance, the Þrm does
not really need production ßexibility and contracting with workers is beneÞcial. If its
shock is positively correlated with ex post wages, the Þrm expects high product demand
when wages are high and and low product demand when wages are low; as a consequence,
its production and demand for labor is stable and ex ante contracts imposes little cost
while oﬀering wage stability to workers.
To make things even clearer, suppose that there are only integrated manufacturers in
the region (Mo = ∅). Then, the hiring choice can be expressed in terms of the demand
shocks (see Appendix):
Fj (MI\M0I , ∅) < 1 ⇐⇒ 2cov (θj ,mI) < var (θj) +

ρ
¸
var (mI)
where mI is the mean of shocks of integrated Þrms that do not contract ex ante: mI =P
k∈MI\M0I θk/(MI −M
0
I). A Þrst result is that no integrated manufacturer hires ex ante
if α = 1 because 2cov(θj ,mI) ≤var(θj)+ var(mI). A second result is that each integrated
Þrm wants to hire ex ante for large risk aversion provided that there remains an integrated
Þrm that does not contract ex ante (mI > 0).
We summarize these results in the following proposition.
Proposition 3 Suppose that there are only integrated manufacturers in the region and
that risks are small. For low values of risk aversion by workers, no Þrm hires ex ante. If
workers are highly risk-averse, all Þrms but one hire ex ante. For intermediate values of
risk aversion, some Þrms may hire ex ante while others hire ex post.
4.2 Labor Contracting and Outsourcing
Let us now consider the nature of labor contracting when some (Mo =M−MI > 0) man-
ufacturing Þrms outsource the provision of components. The makers of components are
22
assumed to be free to enter both before the realization of demand shocks and subsequent
to their realization. In the latter case, entry occurs until ex post proÞts are zero. Entry
prior to the realization of the shocks occurs until expected proÞts are zero.
Smallness is a main feature of monopolistic competition in which component makers
engage. Firms are so small that they do not anticipate having an impact on aggregate
prices and outputs. However, smallness also has implications for the Þnancial management
of Þrms because small Þrms usually have less access to Þnancial markets. In many regions,
the intermediate sector often includes small family-run Þrms funded with limited and
unsophisticated capital structures, perhaps built mainly around family assets. Also, it is
more costly for investors to monitor smaller Þrms; the lack of collateral in small businesses
usually restricts credit (See Audretsch and Elston, 2002). Hence it seems natural to
assume that small Þrms pay a larger risk premium on Þnancial investment than large
Þrms do. This Þnancial issue becomes critical when Þrms consider oﬀering labor contracts
that commit them to speciÞc wage and employment levels. Therefore, small component
producers are less likely to propose ex ante labor contracts than large manufacturing Þrms
that, as we have supposed above, are able to absorb and manage risk with minimal cost.
To capture the diﬀerential costs that small Þrms incur in oﬀering wage contracts,
we assume that each component producer pays a premium as an additional Þxed cost
(τ − 1)aw > 0 (τ > 1) that is proportional to the production Þxed cost a and to the
realization of the wage. The total Þxed cost then becomes τaw. The parameter τ could
represent the transactions costs absorbed by small Þrms when dealing in Þnancial markets,
including the extra staﬃng and other costs that a Þrm must incur when meeting auditing
and control requirements for outside Þnancial counterparties.
Suppose again that L workers and M manufacturing Þrms have settled in a region
and suppose that Mo > 0 manufacturing Þrms have chosen to outsource. As before, Þrms
can hire workers ex post, paying them the stochastic equilibrium ex post wage, or can hire
them ex ante, oﬀering a Þxed wage. Competition in both markets means that all Þrms
23
take as given the market-determined wages, w for the ex post stochastic wage and w0 for
the ex ante Þxed wage. Equilibrium is attained when labor demand is equal to labor
supply both ex ante and ex post.
Again, there are three possible types of equilibrium: one in which all workers are
hired ex ante, one in which all are hired ex post, and one in which some are hired in
both periods. Let N 0 denote the number of component producers that hire in the ex ante
market; N −N 0 is then the number of component Þrms hiring workers ex post.
In the ex ante stage, a component producer i chooses its production x0(i) to maximize
its ex ante proÞt given contractual wage w0. That is, the component producer maximizes
π0(i) = E [p0(i)x0(i)− w0 (τa+ bx0(i))] where, by (5),
p0(i) = x0(i)ρ−1pεδ(MoΨo)1−ρ. (11)
The optimal output and proÞt are computed as

Component producers enter in the ex ante stage as long as they make non-negative
proÞts, which is equivalent to the condition: x0(i) > τx. This condition implies that wage
oﬀers remain low enough for entry to occur. Therefore, component producers enter ex
ante if they are able to oﬀer a wage w0 such that

The Þrst inequality requires that the ex ante wage oﬀers workers a level of utility as
great as the expected utility that they obtain in the ex post market; the second inequality
requires that the ex ante wage is low enough for the component makers to break even.
24
If the Þrst inequality is not satisÞed, workers are unwilling to contract ex ante, and if
the second inequality is not satisÞed, then no Þrms wish to enter ex ante; in either case,
N 0 = 0.
For expository purposes, we distinguish the conÞgurations of regions in which inte-
grated Þrms oﬀer ex ante labor contracts and those in which they do not. Let again
M0I and M 0I denote the number and the set of the former, so that MI −M 0I integrated
manufacturers hire workers in the ex post market.
4.2.1 Integrated Manufacturers Hire only ex ante (M 0I =MI)
When integrated manufacturers hire only ex ante, only component producers are present
in the ex post labor market. If component producers hire workers ex post, free entry
insures that the price index for components will satisfy (7). Given this price index, the
ex ante production of component producers will be
x0(i) =
·
Ew
w0(i)
¸ 1
1−ρ
x.
Therefore, the proÞtability condition x0(i) > x is equivalent to w0 ≤ τρ−1Ew and it follows
that labor will be hired in the ex ante labor market if
Eu(w) ≤ u(w0) ≤ u ¡τ ρ−1Ew¢ .
We analyze the case of perfect and imperfect Þnancial markets in the region.
Perfect Financial Market. When τ = 1, the above condition is always satisÞed. When
Þnancial markets are perfect, free entry implies that the right-hand relationship is satisÞed
as an equality (i.e., w0 = Ew) while the fact that u(Ew) > Eu(w) implies that no workers
are willing to be hired ex post. At the same time, since w0 = Ew, x0(i) = x¯.
We therefore get the following proposition.
25
Proposition 4 Suppose that integrated Þrms (if any) only contract with workers ex ante
(M 0I = MI), and suppose that Þnancial markets in regions are perfect (τ = 1). Then,
component producers always contract with workers ex ante. The ex ante level of output
of each component is equal to its ex post level. Workers receive actuarially fair insurance
against shocks (w0 = Ew) and they have strictly higher utility than if component Þrms
were not able to oﬀer ex ante contracts.
When τ = 1, ex ante entry does not have any impact on ex post wages because the
labor resources required by Þrms contracting ex ante, a+ bx0(i), are exactly equal to the
labor demand of the same Þrms if they hired workers ex post, a + bx. As a result, the
expected utility of workers increases only through better insurance.
Imperfect Financial Markets. When Þnancial markets are not perfect, each component
producer imust produce no less than τx to break even. Because production of components
is inversely related to the ex ante wage w0, component producers tend to oﬀer lower wages
as τ rises. However, when ex ante wages are too small, workers are unwilling to contract
ex ante.
Ex ante wage depends on the anticipation of the level and variance of ex post wages.
In contrast to the case of perfect Þnancial markets in the region, we here need to make
the wages explicit. Ex post wages are subject to two eﬀects: a competition eﬀect in the
component market and a crowding out eﬀect in the labor market. On the one hand,
when a set of Þrms swaps from ex post to ex ante contracting, they depress their own
component price and, through the component market competition, they also depress the
price of ex post contracting Þrms. As result the ex post wage drops. To see this, note
that ex post wages depend on the component prices p0(i) set by Þrms that oﬀer ex ante
contracts (see (11) and apply x0(i) = τx), and on the component prices p set by the Þrms
that enter and contract labor ex post (see (6) and apply x(i) = x). One readily checks
that these prices satisfy the relationship, p0(i)/p = τ ρ−1 < 1. Firms contracting ex ante
have higher Þxed costs to cover and they must then set higher outputs and lower prices.
26
Combining (5) and (6), one can eliminate the price index and get the price set by ex post
contracting Þrms as it follows:
p
ρ
δ = (MoΨo/x)
ρ
εδ [N 0(τρ − 1) +N ]−1. (13)
which, because τ > 1, decreases with N 0. Hence, since p = bw/ρ, when Þrms swap from
ex post to ex ante contracting, they harshen competition and depress the ex post wages.
On the other hand, when some Þrms swap from ex post to ex ante contracts, they
crowd the ex post labor supply out and they force ex post wages to rise. Indeed, at the
equilibrium, the ex post labor clears as it follows:
(a+ bx) (N −N 0) = L− L0I −
Z N 0
0
(τa+ bx0(i))di,
where the LHS is the labor demand by component makers that hire ex post and where
the RHS includes the total labor supply minus the ex ante labor demands by integrated
manufacturing Þrms and by component makers. Ex ante component makers require ad-
ditional labor to pay the Þnancial transaction cost τ . Hence, when these Þrms swap from
ex post to ex ante contracts, they crowd the ex post labor supply out and they push ex
post wages up.
Using the last two expressions and the equalities p = bw/ρ and x0(i) = τx we get the
following ex post wage:µ

εδ (a+ bx)
L− L0I − (a+ bx)N 0 (τ − τρ)
. (14)
which increases in N 0 because τ > τ ρ. When manufacturing Þrms hire only ex ante
(M 0I =MI), ex post wages increase with the number N
0 of component producers that hire
ex ante. The crowding out eﬀect in the labor market dominates the competition eﬀect in
the component market. Also, ex post wages obviously increase with the number Mo of
outsourcing Þrms and vary with their aggregate shocks Ψo, which impact falls when N
0
increases.
27
Let us now study the situation in which component producers are just able to break
even when they oﬀer an ex ante wage that makes workers indiﬀerent between ex ante
and ex post contracting. That is, we look at the situation in which x0(i) = τx and
u(w0) = Eu(w) = u(τρ−1Ew). Two values of the Þnancial cost τ are of particular interest.
Let Þrst τ be that value of τ at which component makers respectively exhaust the full
labor supply ex ante: (τa+ τbx)N 0 = L− L0I. Let also denote by w0 the value of the ex
post wage under the same condition but when Ψo = 1. The ex post wage is thus equal to
w = w0Ψ

When Þnancial costs lie below this value, all component makers hire workers ex ante and
exhaust ex ante the labor supply in the region.
Let then τ be the value of τ at which component makers respectively hire no worker
ex ante (N 0 = 0). As previously, let also denote by w0 the value of the ex post wage under
the same condition but when Ψo = 1. Note that because ex post wages increases in N
0,
we have that w0 > w0. We then get
τ 1−ρ =

When Þnancial costs lie above this value, no component makers hire workers ex ante.
When they lie between τ and τ , component makers hire ex ante only a part of the labor
supply.
Obviously the values of τ and τ tend to 1 when workers risk aversion tends to zero.
In that case, workers put a low value on insurance and any small Þnancial cost impedes
component producers to provide insurance. By contrast when workers are very risk averse,
Þrms provide insurance even at large Þnancial costs.
Note that workers gain better insurance as well as higher average wages. Insurance
by component producers occurs at a cost and that this cost increases the demand for
workers, which raises their wages.
28
Proposition 5 Suppose that integrated Þrms (if any) only contract with workers ex ante
(M 0I = MI), and suppose that Þnancial markets in regions are imperfect (τ > 1). There
exist two values of Þnancial cost (τ , τ) such that
(i) for τ ≤ τ , all component producers oﬀer ex ante wage contracts, ex ante exhausting
the labor supply. These contracts make workers better oﬀ (w0 > Eu(w));
(ii) for τ < τ ≤ τ , some component producers oﬀer ex ante wage contracts, hiring a
portion of the labor force. Workers are indiﬀerent between taking ex ante wage contracts
(u(w0) = Eu(w)) or not but equilibrium expected utility for workers is higher than if no
ex ante contracts were oﬀered; and
(iii) for τ > τ , no component producer oﬀers ex ante an wage contract (u(w0) < Eu(w)).
The ranking of the thresholds (τ , τ ) depend on the properties of the utility function.
For constant relative risk aversion (u(w) = wα/α), the thresholds are independent of the
wage level and are equal to τ = τ = τ0 where
τ1−ρ0 =
EΨ
1/ε

EΨ

o
i1/α .
Hence only two industrial conÞgurations occur: either all or none component Þrms oﬀer
ex ante wage contract to workers.
Corollary 6 Suppose that workers have constant relative risk aversion. Then, there exists
a τ 0 such that all component Þrms hire workers ex ante if τ < τ 0 and none of them oﬀer
hire workers ex ante otherwise.
It is here readily veriÞed that workers gain better insurance as well as higher average
wages. Indeed, when all component Þrms hire ex ante, workers get the utility level u(w0)
which is above or equal to Eu

29
From the corollary, we also infer that τ < τ under decreasing relative risk aversion.
Then, the three conÞgurations of the last proposition exist. That means that when more
component makers oﬀer ex ante contract, ex post wages increase, which rises the ex ante
wage and reduces the attractiveness of the component markets. In contrast, for increasing
relative risk aversion, we have τ > τ . Then, only the industrial conÞgurations (i) and (iii)
occur.
We now turn to regions including integrated Þrms without wage contracts (M 0I < MI).
4.2.2 Integrated Manufacturers Hire ex ante and ex post (MI −MI0 > 0)
When MI −M 0I > 0, some integrated manufacturers have positive ex post demands for
labor. When the ex post supply of labor becomes small, these Þrms are willing to oﬀer high
ex post wages. This impedes component makers to hire the whole set of workers ex ante
because they are unable to oﬀer comparably high wages ex ante. Let Þnancial markets in
regions be perfect (τ = 1) or imperfect (τ > 1). We get the following proposition.
Proposition 7 Suppose that integrated Þrms contract with workers ex post (MI > M
0
I)
and assume constant relative risk aversion. Then there exists a value of Þnancial cost
τ ≥ 1 such that
(i) for τ < τ , some component producers ex ante hire a portion of the labor supply and
workers are indiﬀerent between taking wage contracts or not (w0 = (Ewα)1/α), and
(ii) for τ > τ , no component producer ex ante oﬀers wage contracts.
Proof: see Appendix.
High wages oﬀered by integrated manufacturers refrain component producers to hire
the total labor supply as it can be the case in the previous section. In particular component
producers are never able to exhaust the labor supply ex ante, even at τ = 1. Loosely
speaking, this amounts to set τ = 1 and forbid item (i) in Proposition 5. Still, ex ante
entry of component producers again pushes workers utility up through better insurance,
and, through higher level of wages, as it is shown in expression (16) in the Appendix.

5 Conclusion
In this paper we have explored the interactions between labor market pooling, structure
of production and contracts to workers. By pooling in large regions, workers beneÞt
from a larger labor demands and less volatile wages. By locating in large regions, Þrms
beneÞt from Chamberlinian externalities which entice them to outsource the production
of components. Firms also beneÞt from oﬀering insurance to worker through Þxed wage
contracts.
We develop a model a la Ethier (1982) in which Þrms have increasing returns to scale
and produce their output assembling a set of components. Firms have CES production
function and consumers iso-elastic demands. Firms Þrstly locate in a region, they secondly
decide to outsource or integrate the production of their components, they thirdly choose
to oﬀer wage contracts to workers and they Þnally produce and sell their output. The
model oﬀers several interesting results.
Firms outsourcing decisions may suﬀer from a coordination problem as, for a same
set of economic parameters, equilibria with outsourcing, integration or both structures
may co-exist. In particular, when a region develops by hosting new manufacturing Þrms,
Þrms may be ineﬃciently locked in the integration structure. One has to assume the
existence of institutional structures (city planning, zoning or collusion) to restore the
eﬃcient structure. Furthermore, when Þrms are not ex ante symmetric, Þrms may even
not agree on the optimal structure and institutions must also arrange transfers between
Þrms.
The nature of contract to workers strongly depends on the structure of manufactur-
ing Þrms in a region. First, integrated manufacturers have access to internal or global
Þnancial markets that allows them to insure against both demand risks and wage risks.
Integrated manufacturers are therefore enticed to oﬀer insurance to workers through Þxed
wage contracts. Yet workers beneÞt from insurance is smaller in larger regions with more
diversiÞed risks. Therefore, it turns out that integrated manufacturers tend not to con-
31
tract with workers ex ante in large regions hosting many manufacturers with uncorrelated
shocks but they oﬀer ex ante contracts when shocks are strongly correlated. Manufactur-
ers with shock suﬃciently correlated with the ex post wage hire workers ex ante, whereas
manufacturers with own shocks suﬃciently negatively correlated to ex post wages do not
hire ex ante. Workers receive actuarially fair insurance. Of course, integrated Þrms are
more likely to oﬀer wage contracts when workers are more risk averse.
Second, when manufacturing Þrms outsource, labor contracts are oﬀered by small
component producers. On the one hand, the ability of small Þrms to insure workers
depends on their access to Þnancial markets. Many times small Þrms incur proportionally
much higher Þnancial transaction costs than large manufacturing Þrms. Too high Þnancial
transactions costs impede component Þrms to oﬀer insurance to workers. On the other
hand, component Þrms capture workers by providing insurance to them through wage
contracts. Competition drastically pushes those Þrms to oﬀer wage contracts.
Consider Þrstly a perfect access to Þnancial markets. When the region includes only
outsourcing manufacturing Þrms and component makers, component makers oﬀer wage
contracts to all workers, irrespectively of the risks in the region. This result is at odds with
the contracting decision of integrated Þrms that are less likely to oﬀer wage contracts in
larger regions with diversiÞed demand risks. When the region includes both outsourcing
and integrated manufacturing Þrms, component Þrms are not able to oﬀer ex ante wage
contracts to all workers. Some workers prefer to be hired ex post and to face the risks of
uncertain wages as they anticipate that integrated Þrms may face an ex post shortage of
labor supply and may then push ex post wages up.
Consider Þnally an imperfect access to Þnancial markets. On the one hand, when
Þnancial transaction costs are too high, no component Þrm is able to oﬀer wage contracts.
In particular, there will be no insurance to workers in a large region where Chamberlinian
externalities prevail and thus where all manufacturing Þrms outsource. On the other
hand, for intermediate values of Þnancial transaction costs, the equilibrium includes only
32
some component Þrms oﬀering wage contracts.

Proof of Proposition 7
In Proposition 7, component makers hire ex ante if this option gives them higher expected
proÞt and gives workers higher expected utility. Expected proÞts and utility depend on
ex post prices and wages which expression depends on the existence of ex post entry of
component Þrms. In this Appendix we Þrst derive and compare ex post prices and wages
with and without entry. Then we characterize the equilibrium by comparing the condition
for positive expected proÞt of component makers with the condition for positive expected
utility of workers.
Ex post wages: Let ΨI−I0 be the aggregate shock of the MI −M 0I integrated manu-
facturers that hire ex post. Ex post wages depend on whether component makers enter
ex post or not. They enter ex post if the ex post wage is attractively low. Using (13) and
p = bw/ρ, one can check that
N −N 0 =

so that, for a given N 0, the number of ex post component makers, N −N 0, increases when
the wage falls. So, setting N = N 0, Þrms enter ex post whenµ

We now need to determine the ex post wage. First, if there is ex post entry, ex post
wage is a simple extension of (14) where the aggregate shock of integrated manufacturers

Therefore, for each realization of state θ, there exists a bN 0(θ) such that component makers
enter ex post if and only if N 0 < bN 0(θ).
Second, if there is no ex post entry, then the wage is given by the demand of integrated
manufacturers that hire ex post. The labor market clears when L = L0I + τ(a + bx)N

which is also an increasing and convex function of N 0. Ex post wage tends to inÞnity as N 0
approaches (L− L0I) /τ(a+ bx). As a result the ex post wage is a combination increasing
and convex functions of N 0. The workers expected utility is then also an increasing and
convex function of N 0; so is the certainty equivalent w0 = u−1[Eu(w)] that ex ante Þrms
should oﬀer ex ante to attract workers. When N 0 approaches (L− L0I) / [τ (a+ bx)], the
certainty equivalent w0 tends to inÞnity.
Ex post prices: Component Þrms that hire ex ante commit to a constant production
level and thus face price uncertainty. By (12), these Þrms decide to hire ex ante. if
they make positive expected proÞts, that is, iﬀ bw0/ρ ≤ (τx/Mo)ρ−1E

. The
diﬃculty in computing the expectation term in this condition comes from the fact that
the price index p takes diﬀerent functional forms whenever component makers enter ex
post or not. First, when N 0 < bN 0(θ), component makers enter ex post and the price index
38
p follows the ex post wage according to (7). Then, the function
Ψ1−ρo p
εδ =

(19)
has the same properties as the ex post wage: it is increasing and convex in N 0. Second,
when N 0 ≥ bN 0(θ), component makers do not enter ex post, N 0 = N, and the price index
is deÞned by (5) and (11). This gives the function
Ψ1−ρo p
εδ = Ψo
µ
Mo

¶ρ
(N 0τρ)−1 (20)
which is decreasing and convex function of N 0.
To sum up, for each realization of state θ, the functions w and Ψ1−ρo p
εδ evolve par-
allely as increasing and convex functions of N 0 for small N 0. These functions are still
convex functions of N 0 but diverge for large N 0. In particular, when N 0 approaches
(L− L0I) / [τ (a+ bx)] , the function w increases to inÞnity and the function Ψ1−ρo pεδ de-
creases to a Þnite value. The function w intersect the function Ψ1−ρo p
εδ either zero times
or one time from below.
Ex ante utility and proÞts: We now characterize the ex ante utility and proÞts under
constant relative risk aversion. Let U(N 0) ≡ bw0/ρ = (Ewα)1/α b/ρ and let V (N 0) ≡
(τx/Mo)
ρ−1 EΨ1−ρo p
εδ. Because w and Ψ1−ρo p
εδ are continuous functions of N 0, U(N 0)
and V (N 0) are also continuous.
Let alsoN 0 = minθ bN(θ) be the number of component Þrms below which those Þrms en-
ter ex post for any realization of state θ. Let N
0
= maxθ bN(θ) be the number of component
Þrms above which no Þrm enters ex post for any realization of state θ. From (17), we can
verify that there is ex post entry if no component enter ex ante (N 0 = 0⇒ N > 0) and that
there is no ex post entry if ex ante entrants hire all workers (N 0 → (L− L0I) / [τ (a+ bx)]⇒
N = N 0). Thus, we have that 0 < N 0 ≤ N 0 < (L− L0I) / [τ (a+ bx)].
Equilibrium: Consider Þrst N 0 ∈ [0,N 0]. Component producers enter ex post in any
realization of state; by (19), V (N 0) is a multiple of U(N 0). We readily obtain that V (N 0) ≥
U(N 0) iﬀ τρ−1Ew > (Ewα)1/α where the ex post wage is given by (16). We can compute

such that V (N 0) > U(N 0) iﬀ τ < τ . Note that this threshold is independent of N 0 (because
of the constant relative risk aversion). Therefore, Þrms ex ante enter (N 0 = N 0) if τ < τ ,
no Þrm ex ante enter (N 0 = 0) if τ > τ , Þrms enter for any N 0 ∈ [0,N 0] if τ = τ .
Note then that if V (N 0) ≤ U(N 0) for N 0 ∈ [0, N 0], then V (N 0) ≤ U(N 0) for all
N 0 ∈ [0, (L− L0I) / [τ(a+ bx)]]. Indeed for N 0 > N 0, the function Ψ1−ρo pεδ decreases in N 0
whereas w increases in N 0. So, V (N 0) ≤ U(N 0) for all N 0 ∈ [0, (L− L0I) / [τ(a+ bx)]] if
τ ≥ τ . Hence, no component Þrms hire workers ex ante if τ ≥ τ .
We now consider the case where τ < τ . We know that V (N 0) > U (N 0) forN 0 ∈ [0, N 0];
component Þrms make proÞts when they hire ex ante. For N 0 ∈ [N 0, (L− L0I) /(τ (a+bx))],
by (18) and (20) we have that V (N 0) < U(N 0) for large enough N 0 so that no component
Þrm is enticed to hire ex ante. By continuity of V (N 0) and U(N 0), there exists (at
least) a number N 0 such that V (N 0) = U (N 0). The oﬀered wage is then such that
bw0/ρ = V (N 0) = U (N 0).
Finally observe that component Þrms hire only a portion of the labor supply. Sup-
pose the contrary: component Þrms exhaust the ex post labor supply so that N
0
=
(L− L0I) / [τ (a+ bx)] . Then the ex post wage tends to inÞnity which pushes to the ex
ante wage to inÞnity too. No component Þrm can hire ex ante: N
0
must be nil, a contra-
diction.
