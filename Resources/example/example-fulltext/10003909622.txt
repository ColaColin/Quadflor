A unit-error theory for register-
based household statistics 
 
Abstract: 
The next round of census will be completely register-based in all the Nordic countries. Household is 
a key statistical unit in this context, which however does not exist as such in the administrative 
registers available, and needs to be created by the statistical agency based on the various 
information available in the statistical system. Errors in such register households are thus 
unavoidable, and will propagate to various induced household statistics. In this paper we outline a 
unit-error theory which provides a framework for evaluating the statistical accuracy of these register-
based household statistics, and illustrate its use through an application to the Norwegian register 
household data.

1 Introduction
For some decades now administrative registers have been an important data source for official
statistics alongside survey sampling and population census. Not only do they provide frames and
valuable auxiliary information for sample surveys and census, systems of inter-linked statistical
registers have been developed to produce a wide range of purely register-based statistics (e.g.
Wallgren and Wallgren, 2006). For instance, the next census will be completely register-based in
all the Nordic countries (UNECE, 2007). Reduction of response burden, long-term cost efficiency
as well as potentials for detailed spatial-demographic and longitudinal statistics are some of the
major advantages associated with the use of administrative registers.
The trend is increasingly being recognized by statistical offices around the world (Holt, 2007,
Section 3.1.2). However, also being noticed is that there is clearly a lack of statistical theories for
assessing the quality of register statistics. Administrative registers certainly do not provide perfect
statistical data. Sampling errors are naturally absent. But there exist a variety of non-sampling
errors such as over- and under-coverage, lack of relevance, misclassification, delays and mistakes
in the data registration process, inconsistency across the administrative sources, and not the least
missing data. We believe that a key issue here, from a statistical methodological point of view, is
the conceptualization and measurement of the statistical accuracy in register statistics, which will
enable us to apply rigorous statistical concepts such as bias, variance, efficiency and consistency,
e.g. as one is able to do when it comes to survey sampling.
In this paper we outline a statistical theory for unit errors in register-based household statistics.
Unit errors as such are rarely mentioned in survey sampling and census. The main reason may
be that while the statistical offices collect their own data in surveys and censuses explicitly for
making statistics, the administrative data are by default created and maintained by external
register owners for administrative purposes. One of the problems this can cause is that the
statistical units of interest simply do not exist as such in the administrative registers, and must be
established by the statistical agency in order to obtain the relevant statistical data. Household is a
typical example in this respect. The central population register (CPR) may contain high-quality
information when it comes to judicial and biological relationships within the population. But
there will be no record of household relationship of other kinds. One possibility is to link the CPR
to the dwelling register (DR). But more or less extensive editing and imputation procedures will
be necessary in order to establish a dwelling household register, depending on the quality of the
two registers as well as the linkage between them. Errors will occur in the ‘constructed’ register
(dwelling) households whenever people actually do not live together are wrongly grouped into the
same register household. We call such errors the unit errors.
As a motivating example, consider the household data in Table 1. Suppose that the dwelling
ID is available in the DR, the family ID and person ID are available in the CPR. The statistical
unit of interest is household. Suppose that a register household ID has been created, which is
marked by * in the table to show that it may be erroneous. In this case we assume that the errors
in the register households are due to the poor quality of the DR and its link to the CPR, where
the dwelling ID is duplicated for person no. 1 - 5 and missing for person no. 6 - 7.
A few observations are worth noting. (i) The household register (HR) has unit errors for
Knut, Lena and Ole: in reality Knut and Lena belong to one household and Ole another, whereas

according to the HR Lena and Ole belong to the same household and Knut another. (ii) The unit
error might have occurred for all the 7 persons here. The register households are actually correct
for Astrid, and for Geir, Jenny and Markus, but one would not be able to know that for sure, given
possible mistakes in the dwelling IDs. A statistical theory is therefore needed in order to evaluate
the uncertainty in register household statistics, no matter how good the quality of the underlying
registers may be, as long as they are not error-free in reality. (iii) Unit errors in households
will carry over to all household statistics such as household income or population demographic
statistics, which may or may not have severe consequences. A unit-error theory should enable us
to propagate the uncertainty to such induced household statistics. (iv) The register household is
a unit of central interest in the coming register-based census, a statistical theory that accounts
for the uncertainty due to the unit errors in register households is desirable in this respect.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce a mathematical
representation of the unit errors in register households, as well as the various household statistics
derived from the register households. A prediction inference framework is outlined in Section 3.
In Section 4 we illustrate the proposed unit-error theory using the Norwegian register household
data. Finally, a summary and some discussions will be given in Section 5.
2 A mathematical representation
2.1 Allocation matrix
We assume that the target (statistical) unit consists of one or several base units. The base units are
atomic components that are never to be broken up when the target units are being created. Unit
4
errors arise then from allocating base units into wrong target units. In our motivating example
above, the target unit is household. The base unit can be person. But it can also be family
identified by the family ID, depending on the household definition. If applicable, the latter choice
is more convenient because it reduces the combinatorial complexity of allocation.
We may express the mapping from base units to target units by means of an allocation matrix
A, where aji = 1 if the base unit i is allocated to the target unit j, and aji = 0 otherwise, for
base units i = 1, ...,m. The allocation matrix has dimension m ×m and can be up to rank m,
in which case it is a permutation matrix (i.e. obtainable from the identity matrix through a row
permutation), and every base unit constitutes a target unit by itself. But there will be redundant
rows of zeros if there are fewer target units than base units.
Given persons as the base units, listed as in Table 1, the correct allocation matrix, denoted
by A, and the matrix that corresponds to the household register, denoted by A∗, are given by
A =

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 1 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

A∗ =

1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 1 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

In this way, errors in the target units now correspond to errors in the allocation matrix A∗.
Now, the target units obviously remain the same under any row permutation of the allocation
matrix, except from the ordering among them. For uniqueness of the allocation matrix, it is
necessary to impose a row ordering. Let ji denote the row number of the ith base unit. For
example, in the matrix A above, we have j1 = 1, j2 = j3 = j4 = 2, j5 = j6 = 3 and j7 = 4.
We shall assume that, given the ordering of the base units i = 1, ...,m, the rows of an allocation
matrix are ordered such that ji′ ≤ ji provided i′ < i. Put in another way, this amounts to require
that an allocation matrix should be sequential upper triangular, where an upper triangular matrix
is said to be sequential in addition provided it shall remain upper triangular after deletion of any
number of the first rows and columns that correspond to the base units therein, as long as it is
not all zero afterwards.
2.2 Value matrix and statistical variables of interest
To facilitate statistics of the units of interest, we define a value matrix, or vector, X for the
involved base units, such that the statistical variables of interest can be obtained as a function
of the allocation matrix and X. Often the interest variables can simply be expressed as a linear
transformation of X through the allocation matrix. But it can also be a non-linear function of
such simple linear transformations. Some examples may help to clarify.
- Example 1: Value matrix X = Im×m, i.e. the identity matrix, yields target unit inclusion,
indicating which base units are included in which target unit by definition of the allocation matrix.
- Example 2: Value vector 1m×1 yields the target unit sizes, defined as the number of base units
5
that constitute the target unit. Thus, for A given above, we obtain
A1 = (1, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0)T
- Example 3: Value matrix X = Diag(y)m×m can be used to group the y-values of the base units
according to which target unit they belong to. Thus, for A above, we obtain
A Diag(y) =

y1 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 y2 y3 y4 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 y5 y6 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 y7
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0

The value vector y = (y1, ..., y7)T yields the target unit y-total, such as household income, by
Ay = (y1, y2 + y3 + y4, y5 + y6, y7, 0, 0, 0)T
- Example 4: The target unit mean y-value, such as mean household income above, can thus be
given as a non-linear function
(Ay)//(A1) = (y1, (y2 + y3 + y4)/3, (y5 + y6)/2, y7, −, −, −)T
where “//” denotes component-wise division provided non-zero denominator.
- Example 5: Value vector of sequels, denoted by α = (1, 2, ...,m)T , yields target unit identifier
when multiplied on the left by the transpose of the allocation matrix. For A above, we obtain
ATα = (1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4)T
- Example 6: Suppose in the example above we would like to obtain household age composition
for 4 age groups: < 18, 18− 30, 31− 65 and 66+. We may use the dummy-index value matrix
X =

0 0 0 1
0 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 1 0 0

giving AX =

0 0 0 1

0 2 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0

2.3 Blocking and strata of blocks
In our motivating example above, the street address is used to divide the target population into
smaller groups called blocks, provided allocation is delimited within each block. That is, no base
6
units from different blocks can be allocated to the same target unit. Blocking is important in
practice because it reduces the dimension of the data.
Strata of blocks can be formed that have strong stratum-specific distributional characteristics
of the allocation matrix. The number of base units inside a block is naturally a stratum variable.
For instance, there are only two possible allocation matrices for blocks of two base units:
A1 =
(
1 1
0 0
)
A2 =
(
1 0
0 1
)
which are quite different from the 5 possible allocation matrices for blocks of three base units: 1 1 10 0 0
0 0 0

 1 1 00 0 1
0 0 0

 1 0 10 1 0
0 0 0

 1 0 00 1 1
0 0 0

 1 0 00 1 0
0 0 1

But also other auxiliary information can be used as stratum variables. In the household case,
information such as whether there exists family nucleus or relatives at a given address (i.e. within
a block), age and sex of the residents, the number of children, etc., can all have a strong impact on
the frequency of the possible allocation matrices. Thus, for instance, given a block of two persons
at a given address, the chance that the true allocation matrix is A1 above, i.e. they belong to the
same household, will be close to unity provided they are married to each other according to the
CPR. Whereas the probability can be much lower otherwise.
Finally, the blocks are absolute if allocation of base units across the blocks is strictly forbidden.
Absolute blocks are suitable provided in reality base units across the blocks never (or virtually
never) belong to the same target unit. It is in theory also possible to introduce soft blocks that
have a high probability of being self-contained, but without being strictly delimiting in every
situation. We refer to this as deep blocking. For instance, in Table 1, one may consider deep
blocking that gives rise to three soft blocks: (i) family no. 1 with Astrid, (ii) family no. 2 with
Geir, Jenny and Markus, and (iii) the remaining three single-person families, i.e. Knut, Lena and
Ole. Now, in practice the resulting simplifications may tempt one to take greater risks in deep
blocking. But valid inference must then also take into account the probability of errors associated
with deep blocking. We consider only absolute blocks in this paper.
3 Inference
3.1 Prediction expectation and variance of a target population total
Suppose that the population is divided into strata of blocks, denoted by h = 1, ...,H. Denote
by (hq) the qth block within the hth stratum, where q = 1, ...,Mh and Mh is the number of
blocks in the stratum. Denote by Ahq the allocation matrix for block (hq), and denote by Xhq
the corresponding value matrix (or vector), such that the values of interest associated with the
corresponding target units can be given as a function of AhqXhq, denoted by
thq = g(AhqXhq)
7
Denote by T the corresponding population total, given by
T =
H∑
h=1
Th =
∑
h
(
Mh∑
q=1
thq) =
∑
h
∑
q
g(AhqXhq)
Let A∗hq be the allocation matrix that corresponds to the (hq)-th block in the statistical
register, which is observed throughout the population. We assume that, within the hth stratum,
(Ahq, A∗hq) are jointly independently and identically distributed across the blocks, for q = 1, ...,Mh.
Conditional on the actual statistical register, i.e. A∗h = {A∗hq; q = 1, ...,Mh} and A∗ = ∪hA∗h, the
best prediction of the target total T is given by its corresponding conditional expectation
E(T |A∗) =
∑
h
E(Th|A∗h) =
∑
h
(
∑
q
µhq) where µhq = E(thq|A∗hq) (1)
taken with respect to the conditional distribution of Ahq given A∗hq, denoted by fh(Ahq|A∗hq).
Moreover, let V (T |A∗) denote the variance with respect to the same conditional distribution.
Provided fh(Ahq|A∗hq) is known, the prediction variance is given by
V (T |A∗) =
∑
h
V (Th|A∗h) =
∑
h
(
∑
q
τhq) where τhq = V (thq|A∗hq) (2)
3.2 Estimation of prediction expectation and variance
In practice, of course, we need to estimate the distribution fh(Ahq|A∗hq). Suppose we have available
an audit sample, where Ahq can be identified. It is then possible to obtain an estimate of fh,
denoted by fˆh(Ahq|A∗hq). An estimate of the prediction expectation E(T |A∗) is then given by
Ê(T |A∗) =
∑
h
Ê(Th|A∗h) =
∑
h
(
∑
q
µˆhq) where µˆhq = E(thq|A∗hq; fh = fˆh)
i.e. the expectation (1) evaluated at fh = fˆh. Notice that the audit sample is assumed be of a
negligible size compared to the target population. Should this not be the case, the expression
(1) should be evaluated conditional on the observed thq’s, and the prediction expectation is only
calculated for the units outside of the audit sample.
For the audit sample, it may be the case that regular surveys that collect household infor-
mation, such as the Labor Force Survey (LFS), can be linked to the statistical register. This is
certainly the situation in the Nordic countries. The households of the survey respondents may
then be considered to provide the true allocation matrix. However, from our own experiences,
survey households are often subjected to unit errors just like the register households. Several reme-
dies can be considered. Firstly, joint modelling of the latent true allocation matrix Ahq and the
observed allocation matrices, say, A∗hq from the register and A
′
hq from the survey can be explored.
Secondly, experts can review the collected survey households A′hq, on the background of the reg-
ister households A∗hq and other relevant information available, in order to arrive at the revised
households. Such expert-revised households often have a higher quality than the directly collected
survey households, such that they can plausibly be treated as the true households. Thirdly, it is
8
still possible to verify the most tricky cases by extra field work, which however will raise the issue
of cost. In short, the design of the audit sample is an important question that requires careful
considerations. The solution will depend on the quality of the register and survey households
available, as well as the additional relevant information in the statistical system, such that it is
likely to differ from one country to another.
When it comes to the prediction uncertainty, under the assumption of negligible audit sample
fraction, a naive estimated prediction variance is given by
V̂ (T |A∗) =
∑
h
V̂ (Th|A∗h) =
∑
h
(
∑
q
τˆhq) where τˆhq = V (thq|A∗hq; fh = fˆh)
i.e. the prediction variance (2) evaluated at fh = fˆh. But this is usually an under-estimation of
the true prediction uncertainty, because it ignores the uncertainty in the estimation of fh. An
estimate of the prediction variance that takes this into account is given by
V˜ (T |A∗) =
∑
h
V˜ (Th|A∗h) =
∑
h
(λ1h + λ2h) (3)
λ1h = Efˆh(VAhq(Th|A
∗
h; fh = fˆh)) = Efˆh(V̂ (Th|A
∗
h)) (4)
λ2h = Vfˆh(EAhq(Th|A
∗
h; fh = fˆh)) = Vfˆh(Ê(Th|A
∗
h)) (5)
where EAhq and VAhq are expectation and variance with respect to Ahq that are evaluated at
fh = fˆh, and Efˆh and Vfˆh are with respect to the distribution of the estimated fˆh.
3.3 Bootstrap under a simple stratified multinomial model
We assume a simple stratified multinomial model for the stratum distribution fh(Ahq, A∗hq). More
explicitly, suppose that there are Kh possible allocation matrices for the hth stratum of blocks,
denoted by Ah,k for k = 1, 2, ...,Kh. For 1 ≤ k, j ≤ Kh, let
θh,kj = P [(Ahq, A∗hq) = (Ah,k, Ah,j)] where
Kh∑
k,j=1
θh,kj = 1 (6)
i.e. the probabilities of a multinomial distribution of the pair of allocation matrices. The corre-
sponding estimator, denoted by θˆh,kj , will depend on the design of the audit sample, denoted by
s. In cases where each block in the audit sample has a known inclusion probability, denoted by
pihq, a weighted estimate of θh,kj can be given as
θˆh,kj =
∑
(hq)∈sh
whqIhq;kj/
∑
(hq)∈sh
whq (7)
where sh is the sub-sample containing all the blocks that belong to the hth stratum, and whq =
1/pihq, and Ihq;kj = 1 if (Ahq, A∗hq) = (Ah,k, Ah,j) and Ihq;kj = 0 if (Ahq, A
∗
hq) 6= (Ah,k, Ah,j). Notice
that {θˆh,kj ; k, j = 1, ...,Kh} is simply the sample empirical mass function of (Ahq, A∗hq) provided
equal inclusion probability pihq = pih. In any case, an estimate of the conditional probability of
9
Ahq given A∗hq can then be obtained as
fˆh(Ahq = Ah,k|A∗hq = Ah,j) = θˆh,kj/
∑
g
θˆh,gj
Provided the audit sampling fraction is negligible, we may use a stratified bootstrap procedure.
The following description is given for the hth stratum, and the procedure is repeated separately
in all the strata. Let Ash = {Ah1, ..., Ahnh} be the observed allocation matrices, and let A∗sh =
{A∗h1, ..., A∗hnh} be the associated allocation matrices that correspond to the statistical register,
where nh is the number of blocks within sh. Repeat for b = 1, ..., B:
• Draw (wh(i), Ah(i), A∗h(i)), for i = 1, ..., nh, randomly and with replacement from the observed
{(whq, Ahq, A∗hq); q = 1, ..., nh}.
• Estimate fh from the bootstrap sample {(wh(i), Ah(i), A∗h(i)); i = 1, ..., nh}, denoted by fˆ
(b)
h .
• Evaluate µˆhq and τˆhq at fh = fˆ (b)h to obtain the corresponding Ê(b)(Th|A∗h) and V̂(b)(Th|A∗h).
Given all the B sets of independent bootstrap replicates, we obtain
λˆ1h = B−1

4 An application to Norwegian register household data
4.1 Data
The Norwegian Household Register (NHR) is a statistical register created at Statistics Norway.
It is based on information from many sources, including the census, the CPR, and the register
of Ground Parcels, Addresses, Buildings and Dwellings (SN-GAB). The target statistical unit is
household. The units available are persons, CPR-families (including married couples, registered
partners and cohabitants who are parents of residing children), and dwellings. A unique identifier
is maintained for each type of units, which can be linked to each other at the unit level. The
SN-GAB was introduced in connection with the census 2001, and is still subject to severe errors.
For instance, the dwelling ID was missing for about 7% of the residents in 2005 when the NHR
was first introduced. There exist also a fair amount of registration errors at the street-address
level, as well as among the dwellings at a given street address. Due to these errors it is necessary
to create the NHR for statistical purpose.
For an illustration of the unit-error theory outlined above, we created the following data. The
census 2001 household file provide the target units. A proxy register household file is created for
the Municipality Kongsvinger by adapting the procedures for the NHR to only two data sources,
namely, the CPR which provides us the family ID at the census time point, and the SN-GAB at

the street address level. (As mentioned above, the dwelling identity numbers at multiple-dwelling
street addresses were not available at the last census time point.)
The household data for Kongsvinger are shown in Table 2. We notice the following. First,
the CPR has a serious deficiency when it comes to cohabitants without children. Such a couple
appear as two single-person households, which is why there are many more 1-person households
according to the CPR than in the census, i.e. 4143 compared to 3051 in Table 2. The other
obvious effect of this is the low number of 2-person households according to the CPR, i.e. 2066
compared to 2319 in the census. The net result is that there are many more households in total
according to the CPR, i.e. 8597 compared to 7897 in the census. Next, the procedures underlying
the creation of the household register seem to be able to capitalize on the relevant information in
the statistical system. The two-way register household table is much closer to the census table.
With the dwelling register as an extra data source, the actual NHR can be expected to provide
even better household data. Yet, while Table 2 gives helpful indications on the quality of the
household register, it is not a direct measure of the statistical accuracy.
11
4.2 Model
We set the base unit (BU) to be the CPR-family. The blocks are individual street address. This is
possible because the census employs a ‘formal’ definition of household, where people are ‘placed’
at their CPR-addresses. Using the CPR-family as the base unit can be a problem if household is
defined for people who actually live at the same addresses. Students are a typical group where
the CPR-address (i.e. usually that of the parents) often differs from the actual dwelling address.
For Municipality Kongsvinger this gives rise to 8597 base units, distributed over 5638 blocks.

(II) 2 Without any CPR-couple 526 1052

We assume the stratified multinomial model (6). The strata are formed based on an analysis
of the relationship between census households and CPR-families. The aim is similar to strata
formation in sampling design, i.e. to minimize the within-stratum variation while maximizing
the between-strata variation. That is, we search to identify groups of blocks with clearly distinct
distributions of the pairwise allocation matrices. As mentioned earlier, the number of base units
inside a block (i.e. block size) is a natural stratum variable. The other most important factor
turns out to be whether or not there exist couples within a block according to the CPR, to be
referred to as the CPR-couple. Notice a CPR-couple may be ‘constructed’ based on information
of children in cases where the couple are neither married to each other nor registered as partners.
Table 3 provides an overview of the stratum classification and their distribution. The stratum
of blocks with only 1 base unit (or CPR-family) contains just below 80% of all the blocks, and
about 50% of all the base units. Unit errors are confined to the rest blocks and base units. The
next big group comprises of blocks of 2 base units, further divided into 3 strata. Together they
make up about 15% of the blocks and 20% of the base units. The last group of around 7% blocks
is further divided into blocks of 3, 4, ... base units, such that the effective sample sizes for the
estimation of the corresponding stratum-specific multinomial distributions are rather small. It is
thus quite clear that self-representing audit sample can hardly be efficient for the purpose here.
In practice, disproportional allocation of the stratum audit sample sizes should be considered.
4.3 Result
We now apply the outlined inference approach to the Kongsvinger data. Of course, in reality one
would only calculate the prediction expectation and variance for the units outside of the audit
sample. Our purpose here is illustrative. The questions that we are trying to answer are: (i) what
is the expected household population given that the associated household register looks like the
12
one for Kongsvinger, based on the relationships between the two sources that are observed in the
audit sample, and (ii) what is the associated uncertainty?

The results are given in Table 4. The first row gives the counts of households by size according
to the proxy household register. The second row gives the same counts according to the census
2001. The third row gives the estimated prediction expectations, given by (1), of the corresponding
household population. Notice that the set of actual census counts can be regarded as one particular
realization among all possible household populations associated with the given household register.
The calculation is carried out under the stratified multinomial model that is fitted based on
the data from Kongsvinger. The fourth row gives the naive root squared errors of prediction
(RSEP) given by (2), evaluated at the estimated stratum-specific distributions of the allocation
matrices as if these were known. Finally, the last row gives the RSEPs given by (3) - (5) using
the bootstrap procedure, which take into account the estimation uncertainty. The increase of the
RESP is the largest for the number of 1-person households, and second for the number of 2-person
households. The increments are not noteworthy for the other household counts. In either case,
the census counts are well within the respective 95% prediction intervals based on the Normal
approximation, except from the number of 4-person households which is just on the border of
the interval. The proxy household register counts are for the most part well within the same
prediction intervals, except from the numbers of 2- and 5-person households. These two are also
the ones that actually differ most from the census counts.
5 Summary and discussions
In the above we have outlined a unit-error theory that provides a framework for evaluating the
statistical accuracy of register-based household statistics, and illustrated its use through an ap-
plication to the Norwegian register household data. The issue is certainly relevant for the coming
register-based census, which will be the case in a number of countries including all the Nordic
ones. It is also one step in the broad effort to bring sound statistical methodological foundations
to register statistics.
Several inter-related topics deserve future investigations. First of all there is the design of
audit sample. As noticed earlier, disproportionate allocation of stratum sample sizes should be
considered, in order to handle the varying within-stratum variations efficiently. The identification
of the target units in the audit sample may require a different approach than traditional sample
13
survey. Expert review may prove to be a more cost-efficient alternative in many situations. In-field
data collection may be necessary only for the most difficult cases.
A related matter is statistics on detailed levels. It is convenient to assume that the relationship
between reality and statistical register is the same everywhere in the population. But this can
potentially be misleading. One may need to develop more advanced models that are able to
account for the between-area or -domain variations in the distribution of the allocation matrices.
Alternative design of the audit sample may be explored in this regard.
No matter how good the statistical register may be, there is always a possibility that some
statistics may not be as accurate as the others, as the results in Table 4 have illustrated. A
statistical inferential framework can help to make such assessments, and the analysis can provide
valuable information for the producer of statistics. Nevertheless, whether or not to actually adjust
the register statistics as a consequence of this evaluation will be a question that requires much
more consideration, where the statistical accuracy as well as its underlying assumptions need to
be placed under a bigger context.
The allocation matrix is a generalization of the permutation matrix that is suitable for repre-
sentation of probability-linkage errors. Instead of a single value of one in each row and column,
the allocation matrix allows for multiple values of one per row as well as possible rows of all zeros,
but still a single value of one in each column because a base unit must belong to one target unit
and that only. Parametric and, hence, parsimonious models of the permutation matrices have
been developed (Chambers, 2008), where concentration of values of one along the diagonal (i.e.
correct linkage) may be expected. Parametric modelling of the allocation matrices seems a bit
more complicated, but it is certainly welcome due to the potential improvement of estimation
efficiency. These can possibly replace the simple multinomial model that has been used here.
