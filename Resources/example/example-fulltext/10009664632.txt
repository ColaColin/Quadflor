The European Commission?s Scoreboard of 
Macroeconomic Imbalances ? The Impact of 
Preferences on an Early Warning System 
Abstract 
The European Commission?s Scoreboard of Macroeconomic Imbalances is a rare case 
of a publicly released early warning system (EWS). That allows for analyzing the 
preferences of the involved politicians with regard to the two potential errors of an EWS 
? missing a crisis and issuing a false alarm. This is done for the first time for EWS in 
general by using a standard signals approach including a preference-based optimization 
approach to set thresholds. It is shown that in general, the thresholds of the scoreboard 
are set low (resulting in more alarm signals) as compared to a neutral stand.

Zusammenfassung 
Das Scoreboard der Europ?ischen Kommission zu makro?konomischen Ungleichge-
wichten ist ein seltenes Beispiel f?r ein ver?ffentlichtes Fr?hwarnsystem. Es erm?glicht 
die Analyse von Pr?ferenzen der involvierten Politiker bez?glich m?glicher Fehler in 
einem Fr?hwarnsystem ? eine Krise zu verpassen oder falschen Alarm auszul?sen. 
Diese Untersuchung wird hier zum ersten Mal f?r Fr?hwarnsysteme insgesamt durch-
gef?hrt. Dazu wird eine Standardmethode, ein Signalansatz mit einem pr?ferenz-
basierten Optimierungsansatz zur Bestimmung von Schwellenwerten verwendet. Es 
wird gezeigt, dass die Schwellenwerte des Scoreboards im Allgemeinen recht niedrig 
angesetzt werden, was sich im Vergleich zu einer neutralen Position in mehr Krisen-
signalen ausdr?ckt.

The European Commission?s Scoreboard of 
Macroeconomic Imbalances ?  
The Impact of Preferences on an Early Warning System 
1. Introduction 
On February 15
th
 2012 the European Commission (EC) published its Scoreboard of 
Macroeconomic Imbalances (Scoreboard). It reports a set of macroeconomic indicators 
and provides thresholds that, if crossed, indicate imbalances (EC 2012a, 2012b). If 
imbalances are indicated, the EC undertakes in-depth analysis on whether imbalances 
are present or not. If imbalances are found to be present, member states are asked to 
develop strategies on how to overcome the imbalances and might, if strategies are found 
to be inappropriate or unsuccessful, be fined.1 The whole effort is undertaken as a 
reaction to public debt crises in Europe and has been decided on within the ?six-pack? 
of measures to reshape and tighten fiscal and macroeconomic supervision.2  
While the EC published some comments on why certain thresholds for indicators are 
chosen (EC 2012b), it is unclear to which extent the choice of thresholds is driven by 
specific preferences of the EC, which are not necessarily in line with preferences of 
politicians in the member states or other stakeholders. The preferences of the EC with 
regard to specifying thresholds are unveiled in this paper. The work is done for the first 
time for early warning systems in general. Additionally we compare the forecasting 
results of the official thresholds of the Scoreboard with thresholds derived from neutral 
preferences and suggest adjustments for thresholds. While recent contributions have 
found that, in general, the Scoreboard approach might be promising as an early warning 
system for public debt crises (Knedlik and von Schweinitz 2012), it has not been tested 
so far whether or not the Scoreboard in its current construction is an appropriate early 
warning system. This is undertaken in this paper.

The paper is structure as follows. In section two the methodology is outlined. In section 
three results regarding the Commission?s preferences are presented and the forecasting 
performance of the Scoreboard indicators with official thresholds is compared to a 
neutral stand. Section 4 concludes.  
2. Method and data 
Early warning systems play a prominent role in both the academic literature and in 
practical policies to anticipate financial crises. However, it is only quite recently that 
authors have rediscovered to model aspects of politicians? preferences in the 
construction of early warning systems.3 They show that politicians? preferences 
regarding risk-averseness have a strong impact on the choice of crisis thresholds.  
2.1 The signals approach and preferences 
One of the most simple and widely used methods to construct early warning systems is 
the signals approach developed by Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999)4, which has also been 
shown to produce statistically significant results even if it follows a non-parametric 
approach (El-Shagi et al. 2012). It assumes a strong non-linearity in the relationship 
between indicator variables and financial crises. Indicator variables send a signal, if 
their level crosses a certain threshold. The signal is interpreted as a sign for a looming 
crisis that can be expected to emerge within a predefined period of time. The thresholds 
are set in a way that optimizes the forecasting performance within a sample. In most of 
the earlier contributions, the forecasting performance has been optimized by minimizing 
a noise-to-signal ratio (e.g. Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999). In Demirg??-Kunt and 
Detragiache (2000) and more recent contributions5 thresholds are set in a way that 
minimizes the weighted sum of two potential forecasting errors. First, if thresholds are 
set too high, looming crises might be overlooked (Type I errors). Second, if thresholds 
are set too low, false alarms might be produced (Type II errors). In particular, an early 
                                                 
3 The original contribution is Demirg??-Kunt and Detragiache (2000).  
4 The signals approach has since been employed in many studies e.g. Alessi and Detken (2011), Edison 
(2003), Knedlik and von Schweinitz (2012). 
5 E.g. Alessi and Detken (2011), Bussi?re and Fratzer (2008), Knedlik and von Schweinitz (2012), Duca 
and Peltonen (2012).

warning system can have four potential results: first, a signal is issued and a crisis 
follows (State A); second, a signal is issued and no crisis follows (State B); third, no 
signal is issued and a crisis follows (State C); fourth, no signal is issued and no crisis 
follows (State D). States A and D are the desired results; State C constitutes Type I 
errors; State B constitutes Type II errors. Thus, C/(A+C) is the share of Type I errors in 
pre-crisis periods, while B/(B+D) is the share of Type II errors for tranquil periods. 
All politicians may well be interested in accurate early warning systems, but in 
optimizing an early warning system, there is a trade-off between the two potential errors 
that could occur (e.g. Alessi and Detken, 2011). The minimization of one type of error 
leads to an increase in errors of the other type. Thus, the relative importance of both 
error types has to be defined. Early warning systems are instruments for decision-
making (in other words, deciding whether or not pre-emptive action should be initiated), 
so the relative relevance of the two error types should be decided in line with 
politicians? preferences. Preferences tend to depend on the costs of an error type to a 
politician. Type I errors imply costs because politicians could be blamed for not 
foreseeing and reacting to an emerging crisis with potentially high social costs. Type II 
errors have costs attached because politicians might be blamed for taking unnecessary 
and costly pre-emptive action.  
The utility function for the politician is given by Allesi and Detken (2011): 
                       
 
   
       
 
   
   (1) 
The relative preference of a politician for avoiding the two types of errors with regard to 
indicator I is given by         . Thus,      implies total ignorance of Type II 
errors, whilst      implies total ignorance of Type I errors. The weighted sum of both 
error types gives the loss to the policy maker which enters the utility function 
negatively. The first term of the equation (1) represents the secure loss to the policy 
maker for two cases. In the case of        the policy maker might set the threshold 
extremely low, resulting in no periods without signals (C=B=0) and a loss of       . 
In the case of        the policy maker might set the threshold extremely high so the 
no signal is send at all (A=D=0) and a loss of    will result. Thus,             can

always be ensured and employing an indicator only adds value if the utility function is 
positive. Indicators with negative utility are better left out of consideration. For a given 
  , one can calculate the utility for all potentially meaningful thresholds (which leads to 
different compositions with regard to the four states):  
                        
 
   
                   
 
   
              (2) 
and would then choose the threshold that maximizes utility as the optimal threshold 
(          
 ): 
            
   
           
   (3) 
          
            
      (4) 
Accordingly the derived optimal thresholds can be used in early warning systems. The 
current literature on preferences in early warning systems stops here. 
In this study it is assumed that also different incentive systems might lead to different 
preferences among politicians, e.g. the costs of both error types to a politician vary with 
regard to the institutional setting. While the relevance of institutions for the guiding of 
political action is beyond doubt (e.g. Laffont, 2000) its importance has not been stressed 
in the context of early warning systems, which are employed by an international 
organization and have a serious impact on policy in member countries. If, for example, 
a central bank is responsible for both anticipating a currency crisis and for taking pre-
emptive action (e.g. increasing foreign exchange reserves, and tightening banking 
regulations), the preference for one or the other of the two error types might be more 
balanced than if there is an ?early warning committee? which might be held responsible 
for failing to forecast a crisis, but which is not responsible for undertaking costly actions 
(and might, therefore, attach a lower relative weight to Type II errors). For the EC, 
which takes rather the shape of an early warning committee, because its responsibilities 
with regard to costly precautionary action in cases of a looming crisis are very limited 
(and basically left to member states), a stronger preference for avoiding Type I errors as 
compared to preferences of the member state politicians can be hypothesised.

2.2 Unveiling preferences in early warning systems 
If the construction of an early warning system is known, and in particular if indicators 
and thresholds are known, it is possible to unveil politicians? preferences. This is done 
for the first time in this study. Usually early warning systems are kept secret, for good 
reasons, including the risk of making self-fulfilling prophecies. The Scoreboard on 
macroeconomic imbalances of the EC is an exception to this tendency and allows 
decision-makers? preferences in an international organization to be uncovered. This is of 
high political relevance, since the EC?s preferences might differ from those of 
politicians in individual member states. 
To unveil politicians? preferences we turn the modelling of preferences in an early 
warning system upside-down. We run a standard approach for early warning systems, a 
signals approach, with the specific feature of a utility function to reflect relative error 
preferences (Kaminsky and Reinhart, 1999; Alessi and Detken, 2011). We then check at 
which specific relative preference the known threshold of the Scoreboard is also the 
optimal threshold, as derived from the model. We can then conclude that the respective 
relative preference is the relative preference of the politician(s) concerned. More 
formally we build the inverse function of equation (4): 
  
            
    
     (5) 
Thus, in a case where the threshold is given, we can calculate the utilities for all    ? 
           combinations and pick the    for which the utility has a maximum at the 
given threshold. We call this    the implicit   
  or the implicit weight of Type I errors. 
Since there is an infinite number of potential   
 , we restrict our calculations to two 
decimal places, in other words, 101 calculations per meaningful threshold of an 
indicator. If there is no hit (a given threshold is always either smaller or larger than the 
optimal threshold at any calculated   ), we assume the implicit   
  to be between the two 
  s, where the optimal thresholds switch from above to below the given threshold. If the 
hit range comprises more than one    (the given threshold is optimal for various   ), we 
assume that the implicit   
  is the average    of all    within the hit range. With that 
information, we can assign one implicit   
  to each given indicative threshold.

2.3 Assessing the usefulness of the Scoreboard for politicians 
Once the preferences of the politicians involved in the construction of the Scoreboard 
are unveiled we can compare the official threshold with that derived (as described in 
section 2.1) from a neutral stand of preferences, which we assume to be ?=0.5, i.e. equal 
weights for both error types.6 This allows politicians with other preferences than the EC 
to judge the usefulness of the Scoreboard for their own purposes. It might also hint to 
potential adjustments of the thresholds of the Scoreboard to gain a wider acceptance 
among the members of the European Union. 
2.4 Data 
We use the original EC data set with no transformations. The dataset covers 29 
countries and 10 indicators7 and is available at an annual frequency. We employ the 
data from 1999 to 2010 for all indicators, except for the house price panel, which only 
started in 2006. Crises that the early warning system is meant to signal are defined as 
years in which a new IMF lending arrangement is instituted. We expect early warning 
signals in the year when the programme starts and in the two years preceding the 
lending arrangement. We do not consider the two years following a new arrangement. 
For countries where there is no current crisis, we also ignore the data for 2010, because 
we cannot know at the time of writing whether or not a crisis will follow. This results in 
crises windows as shown in table 1. 
                                                 
6 This assumption is in line with e.g. Alessi and Detken (2011), Knedlik and von Schweinitz (2012). 
7 The indicators are listed in table 2 and described in section 3.2.

We conduct our analysis for the whole set of countries, but also for two sub-groups: the 
euro area countries and the Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC). To avoid 
overlapping of the groups a CEEC that entered the euro area is from that time on 
counted as euro area country. For the remaining group of non-CEEC, non-euro 
countries cannot be controlled for, since there was no incidence of a crisis in that sub-
sample.  
3. Results  
3.1 General results concerning the European Commission?s preferences 
The results from the calculation of implicit preferences are shown in Table 2. The table 
shows that, on average, the weights on Type I and Type II errors are 0.56 and 0.44 
respectively. Running a one-sided t-test shows that the weight on Type I errors is 
significantly larger (at a ten per cent level) than 0.5. Thus, the EC seems to put a larger 
weight on Type I errors than on Type II errors. Taking 0.5 as a reference weight, the EC 
chooses rather low thresholds, resulting in more crisis signals. The highest weights on 
Type I errors are found in the cases of export market share and the house price index 
with   
  of 0.79 and 0.82 respectively. There are however, two exceptions from this 
general finding of relatively low thresholds. In the cases of the international investment 
position and the unemployment rate the EC seems to take Type II errors more serious 
and chooses rather high thresholds. In almost all cases there are differences of implicit

preferences between the two sub-samples. One could assume that the Commission has 
specific country groups in mind, when designing the thresholds. This becomes more 
evident when looking specifically at the different indicators.

3.2 Results for the different indicators 
In tables 3 to 5 we compare the thresholds set by the EC with the thresholds that would 
have to be chosen if ? was 0.5. Table 3 shows that, first, in half of the cases, the official 
thresholds lead to negative utility. This implies that for forecasting purposes, half of the 
set of indicators with those thresholds are not delivering useful insights. Second, utility 
is positive in all cases, if equal weights of the error types are assumed. In only two 
cases, the unemployment rate and the current account balance, thresholds as proposed 
by the EC would be even lower. In the other eight cases, thresholds would have to be 
increased. Similar results are derived for the two sub-samples (see Tables 4 and 5). 
Looking at the different indicators in more detail reveals the picture outlined in the 
following subsections.

3.2.1 Current account balance 
The first indicator of the Scoreboard is the current account balance. The EC proposes 
the three-year backward moving average of the current account balance in percent of 
GDP, with a two-sided threshold of +6% and -4%. Given the data and the threshold we 
can calculate the implicit   
  = 0.59. Thus, the EC seems to worry more about Type I 
errors as compared to Type II errors. However, since the hit range of the given threshold 
with regard to implicit preferences is very broad (ranging from 0.38 to 0.79) also other 
combinations of preferences (in this range) would lead to identical thresholds. The 
positive utility derived, if this indicator is employed, indicates its usefulness in an early 
warning system. The results of the Scoreboard allow identifying three groups of 
countries. In the first country group no signal has been issued at any time (Belgium, 
Denmark, France, Italy, Austria, and United Kingdom). The second group consist of 
countries with almost permanent signals (maximum of 2 out of 12 periods with no crisis 
signal). This group consists of Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, 
Hungary, Malta, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia. The third group, swingers between 
signals and no signals, consist of the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, 
the Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Finland, and Sweden. All countries of the ?no 
signals?-group also belong to the group of countries that never experienced a crisis in 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 15 
the sample. Countries that have experienced crises are almost entirely found in the 
?permanent signals?-group. The only exception is Ireland where signals are only sent 
between 2007 and 2009, reflecting quite good the Irish crisis window of 2008 to 2010. 
Another case stands out in this group: Luxemburg. There signals are sent almost 
throughout the sample, but a crisis never occurred. The reason is that the signals in 
Luxemburg are sent because the current account surplus exceeds the two-sided 
threshold, not the deficit. Similar examples can be found in the ?swinging?-group of 
countries. In Germany (2007-2009), in the Netherlands (2005-2008), in Finland (2000-
2004), and in Sweden (2004-2010) signals are sent for too large surpluses. In none of 
these countries a crisis has emerged. This hints that the current account balance 
indicator would increase its forecasting performance largely, if it would just be used as 
a one-sided indicator, focusing on deficits. The recent signals in Spain and Cyprus hint 
to risk for upcoming debt crisis in these countries. Since we do not observe false alarms 
in CEEC due to surplus-signals, the threshold of +6%/-4% seems to be the appropriate 
threshold for these countries. However, if looking at the euro area countries, the 
threshold should be widened (if for any reason a two-sided threshold is preferred). A 
widening of the threshold to +16.5%/-11% would eliminate all wrong signals from 
current account surpluses and would at the same time reduce the number of too early 
signals in the group of ?permanent signals?-countries and would also increase the 
forecasting performance with regard to the current debt crises in the EMU. However, it 
must be warned that such a change would deteriorate the forecasting performance for 
the CEEC, because the earlier crises of these countries have been signalled from lower 
current account deficit levels already. For the current account balance indicator three 
conclusions can be drawn. First, considering the current account balance as early 
warning indicator for debt crises is very helpful. Second, instead of a two-sided 
threshold, a one-side threshold for current account deficits should be used. Third, 
thresholds should be more specific with regard to the country groups. 
3.2.2 International Investment Position 
The second indicator is the net international investment position. It is expressed in 
percent of GDP. The given one-sided threshold is -35%. Based on the data, we can 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 16 
calculate the implicit preference for Type I errors:   
  = 0.35. It seems that in the case of 
the net international investment position, the EC is more concerned about type II errors 
and sets the threshold relatively high as compared to a reference situation with equal 
weights on both error types. Taking a ?=0.5 as reference, the optimal threshold would 
be -20%. However, also the higher threshold leads to a positive utility, making the net 
international investment position a valuable indicator. With the given threshold of -35% 
eleven out of 27 countries do not show any signal during the period of observation. The 
group of ?permanent signals?-countries comprises Estonia, Greece, Spain, Latvia, 
Hungary, and Portugal. The ?swinging?-group includes Bulgaria, Czech Republic, 
Ireland, Cyprus, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, and Finland. Thus, the 
crisis countries are again mostly found in the group with almost permanent signals, 
except for Bulgaria, Ireland, Lithuania, and Romania. In Bulgaria and Lithuania crisis 
signals are sent in all periods outside the crisis window and none is sent within. Thus, 
the international investment position is a perfectly wrong indicator for these countries. 
For Ireland and with regard to the second crisis episode in Romania the signals are sent 
as desired. The only country in ?permanent signals?-group that did not experience a 
crisis so far (according to the definition used) is Spain. Among the eleven countries with 
no signal at all, there is no country that ever experienced a crisis in the sample. 
Reducing the threshold to -20% obviously leads to more signals (174 instead of 112). 
Better results are yielded in Romania, where also the first crisis episode would have 
been forecasted. In Lithuania and Bulgaria crisis signals would be sent also during the 
crisis window. However, also some more falls alarms would be issued, for example in 
Austria and Sweden at the beginning of the sample and in Spain and Italy at the end of 
the sample period. The later might again hint to unfolding crises in these countries. In 
sum, however, performance measures are better again for the threshold derived with an 
equal weight on both error types. One interesting feature of the international investment 
position is that whilst for all countries the threshold should be reduced, that is not the 
case if the threshold is optimized for the euro area alone. As mentioned above, the 
reduction of the threshold would lead to better results in CEEC countries only, and 
would lead to more false alarms in euro area countries. Thus, for euro area countries the 
optimal threshold (assuming equal weights on both error types) would be -70%. Thus, 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 17 
for the case of the euro area, the official threshold would be too low. In sum, the 
international investment position is a good crisis indicator. However, as compared with 
the neutral stand, the official threshold is set too high if all countries or CEEC are 
considered but is set too low if the euro area is considered only.  
3.2.3 Real effective exchange rates 
The real effective exchange rate indicator is the percentage change over three years of 
the real (deflated by the consumer price index) effective (trade weighted) exchange rate. 
The Commission proposes in the case of this indicator to use different two-sided 
thresholds for euro area countries (+/-5%) and non-euro area countries (+/-11%). The 
use of these thresholds indicates that over all countries the EC is a bit less worried about 
Type II errors, which indicates that the threshold tend to be set relatively low as 
compared to equal weights on the error types. Employing the indicator with the given 
thresholds leads to a utility of below zero, meaning that the indicator has no use to 
forecast crises. Why that is the case becomes clear when looking at the results for 
different countries over time. We find that the group of countries with almost permanent 
signals is empty. The group of countries with no signals at all just amounts to two 
(Denmark and Cyprus). All other countries belong to the swinging group and show 
some signals sometimes. This is astonishing when remembering that only eight out of 
27 countries ever experienced a crisis in the sample period. Looking at the crisis 
countries delivers: In Bulgaria we have an almost equal number of correct signals and 
false alarms; in Ireland more false alarms then correct signals are sent; in Estonia, 
Greece, Hungary, Portugal only wrong signals are sent; in Lithuania some more good 
then wrong signals are sent; and in Latvia and Romania only correct signals are sent. 
Over all countries signals since 2003 are only sent due to large real appreciations of the 
exchange rates, except for three signals in Poland and the UK. Before 2003 in the euro 
area signals are only sent because of large real depreciation of the exchange rates, while 
in the CEEC signals are again only sent due to large real appreciations. Since the crises 
in euro area countries happened at the later part of the sample, all signals due to real 
depreciations in the euro area are wrong. Regarding CEEC there is only one signal due 
to real depreciations (Poland in 2004), which is also wrong. Thus, the use of a two-sided 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 18 
indicator is worsening dramatically the forecasting performance of the real effective 
exchange rate indicator. The Scoreboard should, therefore, use a one-sided indicator, 
focusing on real appreciations. However, even if a one-sided indicator is used, the real 
effective exchange rate might not be an appropriate indicator for the euro area, since for 
these countries the real effective exchange rate is to a large extent driven by 
developments of the nominal euro exchange rate, which limits its ability to differentiate 
between different euro area countries. If, for some reason, a two-sided indicator needs to 
be used, it should be used with much higher thresholds for CEEC (+/-28%). For the 
euro area, the threshold should be reduced to +/-4%, resulting in better forecasts for the 
crisis episodes in Ireland and Greece. That would at least increase the negative utility to 
around zero. To have a useful competitiveness indicator, one would need to consider a 
one-sided indicator that takes intra-euro area imbalances more effectively into account. 
Elsewise, real effective exchange rates should not be used to judge the performance of 
countries with regard to crisis probabilities. 
3.2.4 Export market shares 
The export market share indicator is the five year percentage change of the export 
market share. The threshold is set at -6%. At a first glance that indicator seems to be one 
of the worst performing indicators of the Scoreboard, the utility is very low, the   
 =0.79 
over all countries indicates that the threshold is set much lower as compared to a neutral 
stand regarding the weights of the error types, where it would be set at -19%. The 
picture looks very different if only euro area countries are considered. In that case, the 
forecasting performance is among the better once and the threshold derived based on 
equal weights of the error types, -8%, is also not far from the official threshold. It seems 
that the Commission tailored this indicator specifically for the euro area countries, while 
still employing it for all countries. Regarding the euro area program countries we get 
some correct signals in all cases, while false alarms are limited. For the CEEC crisis 
countries we get none but one correct signal for an upcoming crisis (Bulgaria in 2000). 
The only countries with almost permanent (wrong) signals are France and Italy. No 
signals are sent over time in Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, 
Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Slovakia. The remaining 18 countries belong to the 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 19 
swinging group, including the before mentioned euro area crisis countries (Greece, 
Ireland, Portugal) with rather correct signals. Assuming that the indicator works quite 
well for the euro area, we get current (2010) alarm signals in all euro area countries, 
except for Estonia, Malta, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Increasing the threshold to -12.5% 
for CEEC, as derived by a neutral stance regarding error types for these countries, 
would result in some correct crisis forecast in Bulgaria and would produce limited false 
alarms, increasing utility to just zero. The indicator works so poorly in CEEC, since the 
countries experienced a period of integration into the world markets, where increases in 
the export market shares have been reached in almost all countries in almost all periods, 
regardless of the incidence of crises.  
3.2.5 Unit labour costs 
The unit labour costs indicator is defined as the three year percentage change of nominal 
unit labour costs. The one-sided thresholds are +9% for euro area countries and +12% 
for non-euro area countries. Regarding the Commissions preferences, it seems that for 
unit labour costs, we have similar picture as for most of the indicators. The EC shows a 
higher preference for not missing a crisis as compared to avoiding false alarms. As in 
the case of real effective exchange rates, the findings vary over the sub-samples of the 
EU member countries. While we find that for euro area countries the threshold of +9% 
is rather high as compared to a neutral stand, the threshold for CEEC of +12% is too 
low. As with the case of export market shares, the phenomenon can be explained by the 
catching-up process of the CEEC. According to the Balassa-Samuelson effect prices can 
be expected to grow faster in a catching-up process, thus also labour cost might increase 
at a higher rate without signalling risks for crises. For the EC, which only allows itself 
to differentiate between euro and non-euro area members, it is difficult to find a 
threshold for the later group, which comprises CEEC as well as the more mature 
economies of Denmark, Sweden and the UK. Taking a look on the signals reveals that 
there is just one country with permanent signals, Romania. There are also only a few 
countries (Germany, France, and the UK (with the higher threshold of non-euro-area 
countries)) that show not a single signal. The remaining countries show at least some 
signals. The crisis episodes in CEEC have been signalled in about half of the periods 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 20 
(and all periods in Romania). In Ireland and Greece in two thirds of the pre-crisis 
periods signals are sent, whilst none is sent in the Portuguese case. We have a total of 
85 false alarms, mainly occurring in CEEC, but also notably also in Spain and in non-
crisis window periods in Ireland and Portugal. Decreasing the threshold to +7%  for the 
euro area (as derived if equal weights are assumed for both error types) would lead to 
better forecasts in Greece and Portugal, with limited additional false alarms. Increasing 
the threshold for CEEC to +22% (as derived from equal weights) a lot of false alarms 
would be avoided so that utility of the indicator could turn positive for this country 
group. In sum, unit labour costs are indeed one of the better indicators for crises. 
However, while the threshold values for euro area countries are almost adequate 
(thought a bit too high), they are far too low for CEEC in the current setting. That limits 
the overall performance of the indicator in its current setting. 
3.2.6 House prices 
The house price indicator is defined as the annual growth rate of the real house prices 
index. The Commission uses a one-sided threshold of +6% to indicate imbalances. The 
indicator performs exceptionally poor to forecast crises in our sample. In particular it 
performs very poor in the euro area, also if adjusted thresholds would be used. It seems 
to have some explanatory power for CEEC, if the threshold would be increased by 
large. The used threshold shows, that for house prices the EC seems to almost ignore the 
risk of false alarms to the advantage of missing as less as possible crisis signals. 
However, that is still not very successful. All signals of the indicator are false alarms 
with the exceptions of Latvia in 2006 and 2007. There are two main problems relating 
the house price indicator: First, the data sample starts only in 2006 and the panel is not 
balanced, e.g. there is no data for Hungary and Romania during their respective crisis 
windows. Thus, this very limited amount of data does not allow for a comprehensive 
judgement of the indicator. Second, it is very unclear, why (except for the first problem) 
in the case of house prices the Commission used the year-on-year percentage change 
instead of a change over a longer period, say of three years (as with the real effective 
exchange rate and the unit labour costs) or five years (as in the case of export market 
shares). That would be much more appropriate as the cases of the current crisis in 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 21 
Ireland might show exemplary. The crisis that is indicated by the start of the IMF/EU 
program for Ireland emerged only a few years after the crash of the property market. 
Thus, price increases of houses could only have been observed before that. Thus, while 
the bursting property price bubble in Ireland is probably one of the main causes of the 
crisis, an annual change of the house price is not a good indicator in the two-year early 
warning horizon. Because of both problems, the house price indicator should be 
dropped from the Scoreboard until appropriate data is available. 
3.2.7 Private sector credit flow 
The indicator measures private sector credit flows in percent of GDP. The threshold is 
set at 15%. The analysis shows that also in the case of private sector credit flows, the 
EC aims to avoid Type I errors at the cost of Type II errors (  
 =0.58 over all countries 
of the sample). Thus, the threshold is set relatively low as compared to a neutral stand. 
However, there are, as with other indicators, differences between country groups. While 
a neutral threshold would be 27% for all countries and even 39% for the euro area, it 
would be just 13% if the CEEC would be considered only. The overall poor 
performance of the indicator at the given threshold is expressed by negative values for 
the utility. That could however be turned into slightly positive values, if the thresholds 
based on neutral stands would be used ? rendering the indicator a useful tool for the 
anticipation of risk, though it would still not range among the best performing 
indicators. Taking the 15% threshold, the indicator signals quite well the more current 
crisis episodes in Latvia, Hungary, and Romania, but misses to signal the less recent 
crises in Latvia and Romania and also the crises episode in Estonia, Lithuania, and 
Portugal. Some indications are provided in the cases of Bulgaria, Ireland, and Greece. 
Almost permanently (wrong) signals are sent for the UK and Spain. However, there are 
also of few countries with (correctly) no signals at all: Czech Republic, Germany, 
France, Italy, Poland, and Slovakia. Increasing the threshold considerably (to 27%) 
would lead to much less false alarms but also reduces correct signals (to a lower extent). 
As mentioned above, for CEEC the threshold should actually be lower. That would 
ensure even more correct crisis signals by relatively low numbers of false alarms ? 
which were mainly produced in euro area countries but also in the UK, Denmark and 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 22 
Sweden. In sum, the indicator would profit substantially from using regionally 
differentiated thresholds. However, its performance remains limited as compared to 
other indicators of the Scoreboard.  
3.2.8 Private sector debt 
The eighth indicator of the Scoreboard is private sector debt. It is measured as the stock 
of private sector debt (the sum of non-consolidated loans and securities other than 
shares) in percent of GDP. The threshold is set at 160%. The calculated   
 =0.53 
indicates again a preference for avoiding Type I errors. Even thought that the calculated 
value is not far from equal weights, the usage of ?=0.5 would result in a largely 
increased threshold of 240% over all countries, which would also be optimal if euro 
area countries would be considered only. For the CEEC subsample, however, the 
threshold would have to be decreased to 100%. Accordingly, if the implicit weight of 
error type preferences would be calculated for CEEC only, the EC would seem to care 
little about missing a crisis (  
 =0.35 for CEEC only). Taking the given threshold of 
160%, the indicator would indicate the current crises in Portugal and Ireland, but no 
other crisis. The indicator would produce false alarms almost constantly in Belgium, 
Denmark, Cyprus, Malta, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the UK. In nine countries no 
signals are sent throughout the sample period, including the crisis countries Greece and 
Romania. For CEEC, a reduction of the threshold to 100% would mean that the recent 
crises in Hungary, Romania and Latvia would have been signalled with an acceptable 
level of additional false alarms, so that the negative utility of the 160% threshold for 
CEEC would turn into positive if 100% are used as threshold. However, if the 100%-
threshold would be employed for the euro area, permanent (wrong) signals would be 
produced for almost all countries in almost all years. However, increasing the threshold 
to 240% would still signal the crises of Ireland and Portugal (with indicator values of up 
to above 330% in Ireland), while reducing the number of false alarms to zero. Thus, the 
level of private debt is a very good and accurate indicator for crises in some cases; it 
does not play a central role in all crises. Again, the divergence of European countries 
needs to be considered in order to make the indicator useful. For the euro area, private 
sector debt would be the third best performing indicator (after the international 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 23 
investment position and the current account balance) ? if appropriate threshold would be 
employed.  
3.2.9 Public sector debt 
The public sector debt indicator is defined as the general government debt in percent of 
GDP. In line with the Maastricht criteria, the threshold is set to 60%. The indicator 
threshold is again chosen by focusing more on Type I errors as compared to Type II 
errors (  
 =0.53 over all countries). The 60%-threshold leads to almost permanent crisis 
signals in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Greece, and Italy, which have ? except for 
Greece ? not experienced a crisis. On the other hand, no signals are sent in eight 
countries, including the crisis episodes in Estonia and Romania. The only correctly 
signalled crises are that of Greece, Hungary and Portugal and to some extent also the 
crises of Bulgaria and Ireland. For that reasons, the indicator (with the given threshold) 
performs poor in forecasting crises and produces negative utility if the whole sample of 
countries is considered. That would change, if adjusted thresholds would be used. Over 
all countries, the neutral threshold would be 110%. With this indicator-threshold, only 
the crisis in Greece would have been predicted, but false alarms would be reduced to 
two. With that, utility would turn positive but the indicator would still remain among to 
poorest performing indicators. These results seem to be contraire to common thought, 
but can be (again) reasoned by the very different applicability of threshold to the 
different country groups. The 110% threshold would be chosen to minimize false alarms 
that are also occurring among the non-euro area, non-CEEC countries. For the euro area 
countries, the loss of correct crisis signals would not be outweighed by more correct 
predictions of non-crises periods. Accordingly, the threshold would be set lower, if the 
euro area countries are considered only, to 80%. That would restore crisis signals in the 
cases of Portugal, Greece and to some extent in the case of Ireland, by still producing 
less false alarm as compared to the 60%-threshold, e.g. the false alarms for Germany 
would disappear. Thus, the indicator would be the fourth best performing indicator for 
the euro area at the 80%-threshold. Regarding the CEEC, the 60%-threshold 
corresponds with a wide hit-range regarding the error preferences. For preferences for 
Type I errors of between   =0.23 and   =0.54, 60% would be the optimal threshold. 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 24 
Thus, also for the neutral stand of ?=0.5, the given threshold is optimal for these 
countries.  
3.2.10 Unemployment rate 
The final indicator of the Scoreboard is the unemployment rate, measured as the three 
year backward moving average of Eurostat?s unemployment rate. The threshold is set at 
10%. The unemployment rate is one of the few indicators with positive utility also in the 
case of using the official threshold. It is also one of two indicators (besides the 
international investment position) where the Commission seems to have a higher 
preference for avoiding Type II errors (false alarms) ? indicated by   
 =0.45. Thus, as 
compared to a neutral stand, the threshold is set too high for the all-country case, but 
also if the two subsamples of the euro area (  
 =0.37) and the CEEC (  
 =0.49) are 
considered separately. With a 10%-threshold, only the earlier crises in Latvia and 
Lithuania would have been correctly forecasted, with some indication also given for the 
crises in Estonia, Ireland, and Portugal. The crisis periods in Romania, Hungary, Greece 
and the later episode in Latvia would have been missed. With this high threshold, false 
alarms are limited, occurring mainly in Slovakia, Poland and Spain. With reducing the 
threshold to 6%, which would be optimal based on a neutral stand for the samples of all 
countries and the CEEC subsample, basically all crisis periods (with just two 
exceptions) would be correctly called. This leads to an increased number of false 
alarms, but overall utility would be largely positive. Reducing the threshold even 
further, to 5% as it would be optimal for euro area countries, would eliminate the 
remaining two periods with no signal before a crisis, by producing only a few additional 
false alarms in the euro area. Still the number of false alarms is high, including almost 
permanently (wrong) signals in Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Finland, if 
such a low threshold is used. The indicator is characterized by limited variations over 
time, but quite excessive variations over countries. However, if unemployment is rising, 
it is a good indicator for a crisis to come.

3.3 Discussion of results 
3.3.1 Discussion of the European Commission?s preferences 
Thus far, academia has had to speculate about politicians? preferences regarding Type I 
and Type II errors in the construction of early warning systems. With regard to costly 
asset price booms, Alessi and Detken (2011) state that they ?believe a ? smaller than 0.5 
is a realistic description of central bankers? loss functions?, while Bussi?re and 
Fratzscher (2002) assume that in the case of currency crises ?Type 2 errors may be less 
worrisome from a policy-maker?s perspective?. With regard to the European 
Commission?s Scoreboard, we can now state that, on average, Type II errors do indeed 
seem to be less worrisome to policy-makers. This provides evidence for the hypothesis, 
that the EC, acting more as an early warning committee than as a full-fledged crisis 
preventer (that would also be responsible to undertake costly action), bothers more 
about missing a crisis than about calling alarm if there is indeed only limited evidence 
of an upcoming crisis. However, preferences also seem to vary with regard to the 
indicators employed. While in most cases thresholds are set lower, than if both error 
types were equally important, there are also cases in which the thresholds that are set 
seem to be rather high. In the case of the international investment position, the relative 
high threshold might be due to a compromise between the CEEC group and the euro 
area country group. Whilst in the former the indicator works very well with a low 
threshold, in the later case a higher threshold would be optimal. In the case of the 
unemployment rate, it might have been of relevance that false alarms due to a lower 
threshold would mainly be found in the largest euro area economies (e.g. in Germany, 
France, Italy, and Spain). That might indicate that the Commission uses some weighting 
scheme of countries when deriving thresholds. Additionally there are also differences 
with regard to the different sub-samples.  
3.3.2 Discussion of forecasting performance and threshold adjustment 
The general picture that most indicators (using official thresholds) perform poorly could 
be changed in most cases, if thresholds would be adjusted.  Already the use of optimal 
threshold based on equal weights of the error types would result in positive utility for all 
indicators, and would, thus, increase their relevance for early warning system 
 IWH  __________________________________________________________________ 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 26 
fundamentally. However, also the consideration of country group specifics would 
increase the forecasting performance of the Scoreboard indicators further. While the 
differentiation between euro and non-euro countries, as used by the Commission in 
some cases, can be considered as a first step into that direction, it is not going far 
enough. In particular, the grouping does not allow to differentiate between different 
levels of economic development and ignores catching-up processes in CEEC. Also the 
characteristics of the non-euro, non-CEECs are ignored. These countries are in many 
characteristics closer to the euro-area countries than to the CEEC (which whom they are 
grouped by the Commission).  
There is just one indicator, unemployment, for which the derived optimal thresholds are 
at least almost the same for the two subsamples of the analysis. A threshold of about 6% 
would do a proper job for the whole region, though the indicator performs still relatively 
poor in CEEC. With all other indicators different threshold for CEEC and the euro area 
would increase the performance substantially. For the two indicators for which the 
Commission proposed a higher threshold for non-euro area countries, this would also be 
suggested by the present results. However, the differentiation should be even stronger: 
Instead of -/+5% for the euro area and -/+11% for non-euro-area countries for the real 
exchange rate indicator, we should have -/+4% the euro area and -/+28% for CEEC. 
Also in the other case, unit labour costs, the neutral stand would lead to an even lower 
threshold for the euro area and a much higher threshold for the CEEC. Moreover, also 
with regard to export market shares and house prices, the CEEC need higher thresholds 
as compared with the euro area. These indicators have in common, that they reflect 
price developments that might be more dynamic in emerging market economies without 
causing crisis risks (the exception are export shares, which are a poor indicator for 
CEEC anyway, as stated above). For all other indicators counts, that the euro area 
should have higher thresholds as compared to CEEC. This concerns the foreign trade 
indicators (current account balance and international investment position) and public 
debt, where larger imbalances can be burdened by the more mature economies, and 
private sector debt and credit. The latter cases might reflect the general development of 
financial markets, which results in both higher flows and stock of loans. In both cases 
much higher figures could be allowed for euro area countries. If the derived thresholds 
 _________________________________________________________________  IWH 
 
IWH Discussion Papers No. 10/2012 27 
of country groups would be employed (taking the whole sample as reference for the 
non-euro, non-CEEC) the Scoreboard results for 2010 (the most recent incidence) 
would change as presented in Table 6. It shows that only in three country cases results 
would remain unchanged as compared to the original Scoreboard. Overall 28 additional 
signals would be sent and 26 original signals would be scratched. The additional signals 
result mainly from two indicators, unit labour costs and the unemployment rate, which 
should gain more attention. The scratches are more spread over different indicators, 
with 14 scratches happening for the public and private debt indicators. In most country 
cases some signals are added while also some are scratched. There are three country 
cases with two additional signals: France, Italy, and Hungary, which should be looked 
after more carefully. 
4. Conclusions 
The current construction of the Scoreboard allows for unveiling the preferences of the 
involved policy makers with regard to their error preferences. In general, the EC shows 
a higher relative preference for avoiding Type I errors as compared to avoiding Type II 
errors. This can be explained by the Commission?s specific design as an early warning 
mechanism without direct responsibilities to undertake costly action if an emerging 
crisis is signalled. Assuming that politicians that also have to account for costs of 
potentially unnecessary pre-emptive action might have different preferences and would 
put a higher weight on avoiding Type II errors, we use equal weights for both error 
types as a reference system. This results in the finding that the current Scoreboard is in 
most cases too alarmistic, while threshold for two indicators (unit labour costs and the 
unemployment rate) are set rather high. Thus, preferences have an important influence 
on thresholds in early warning systems. To avoid the setting of threshold in accordance 
with the preferences of just a part of the stakeholders and thereby limiting its acceptance 
for others they should be openly discussed.
