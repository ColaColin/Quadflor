Tax-Favored Retirement Accounts: Are they E?cient
in Increasing Savings and Growth??

Abstract
The present paper aims to quantify the macroeconomic and welfare e?ects of tax-
favored retirement accounts. Starting from an equilibrium without saving incentives,
we introduce such accounts and compute the new transition path and the resulting
long-run equilibrium. Since our overlapping-generations model comprises a detailed
progressive tax system, borrowing constraints as well as stochastic income risk, we
can compare macroeconomic and liquidity e?ects, tax distortions and the insurance
properties of the policy reform.
Our simulations indicate that tax-favored retirement accounts as implemented
in many OECD countries will have a signi?cant impact on capital accumulation and
wage growth in the long run, but only yield insigni?cant aggregate e?ciency changes.
While elderly generations are typically hurt by such a reform, young and future
generations bene?t. Finally, with respect to the intragenerational redistribution, a
subsidy system that includes direct bonus payments might be preferred to a system
with pure tax deductions.

1 Motivation
Like many other countries in the past, Germany has recently introduced individual re-
tirement accounts (IRAs, popularly referred to as ?Riester accounts? after the former
labor minister Walter Riester) in order to compensate individuals for the future decline
in public pensions. Income that is saved in these accounts is given a tax relief, the accu-
mulation during the saving phase is tax exempt and quali?ed withdrawals are taxed as
normal income.
In principle, German IRAs work similar as the respective accounts in the US or in Britain,
but there are also some important di?erences with respect to the government regulation
and the provided saving incentives1. Since the incentives are especially designed for low
income households, they can take two forms: direct bonus payments which depend on the
household characteristics (number of children, non-entitled partners) and tax deductions
as special expenses. While the former are usually more advantageous for low income
households, the latter will be chosen by higher income earners. In order to qualify for the
maximum bonus payment, the bene?ciary must invest a speci?ed percentage of his gross
earnings, otherwise the transfer payment is reduced accordingly. With respect to the tax
deductions there exists an annual contribution ceiling which will be ?nally ?xed at 2.100
e and in the case of early withdrawal (i.e. before age 60) the accumulated previous tax
savings and government subsidies have to be reimbursed to the tax authorities. Finally,
approved payment plans must provide a life annuity after retirement.
The present paper aims to provide a comprehensive economic assessment of such savings
subsidies. Since in Germany the take-up rate for IRAs was quite disappointing initially
and only increased recently, it is important to isolate the policy instruments which are
successful in boosting private savings. But the amount of contributions to IRAs alone is
only a weak indicator for the policy e?ectiveness. With respect to the savings performance
it is crucial whether contributions are funded from additional savings or diverted from
other saving. In order to evaluate the distributional impact, it is important to know how
the tax incentives bene?t workers from di?erent income levels and cohorts. It is also
necessary to quantify the current and future budgetary implications in order to assess
the implied tax distortions. Finally, in an uncertain environment we need to know how
the reform alters the risk allocation across and within generations in order to judge its
insurance e?ects.
While tax-favored retirement accounts were already introduced two decades ago in the US,
1A more detailed description of the German IRAs and a comparison of tax-favored retirement saving
plans in OECD countries can be found in OECD (2005).

there is still an ongoing discussion about their economic performance. At least partly this
controversy is due to the limited data availability and the problems with the econometric
speci?cation, see Bernheim (2002) for a survey and discussion of this literature. For this
reason we simulate the introduction of tax-favored retirement accounts with a numerical
simulation model. This approach allows to isolate and compare the resulting individual
reactions and macroeconomic consequences as well as to evaluate the welfare and e?ciency
implications of such reforms.
Already Engen et al. (1994) have examined the e?ectiveness of individual retirement
accounts in the US. Applying a partial equilibrium life-cycle model, they compute the op-
timal individual saving behavior for alternative contribution limits and withdrawal rates.
Their simulations indicate that individuals will mainly substitute from liquid savings in
the short run and increase their aggregate savings only slightly in the long run. The
present study applies a general equilibrium model which was pioneered by Auerbach and
Kotliko? (1987) and has been recently extended to include idiosyncratic income risk2.
I?mrohorog?lu et al. (1998) evaluate in this framework the long-run consequences of IRAs
on the US capital stock for various contribution limits and tax savings instruments. They
conclude that about 9 percent of IRA contributions during the 80ies constituted additional
savings which raised the US capital stock by about 6 percent.
While I?mrohorog?lu et al. (1998) do not provide a welfare analysis, applications such as
Huang et al. (1997), De Nardi et al. (1999) or Conesa and Krueger (1999) evaluate
the long run e?ects and the transition path when the current US pension system is ei-
ther replaced by a two-tier system of personal saving accounts or completely eliminated.
While these studies are able to compare the intergenerational welfare consequences of the
considered reforms, they did not compute the aggregate e?ciency gains or losses, which
is required for an an overall assessment. Consequently, our study follows Nishiyama and
Smetters (2005) as well as Fehr and Habermann (2005) who isolate the insurance and
distortionary e?ects of the considered policy reforms by compensating agents along the
transition path with lump-sum transfers or taxes. Compared to the original study of
I?mrohorog?lu et al. (1998), our approach also includes a richer structure of individual
preferences as well as a progressive tax and subsidy system.
We ?nd that a reform with unlimited tax deductions where the tax shortfalls are ?nanced
by consumption taxes and public debt yields the strongest growth e?ects and aggregate
e?ciency gains while the implied welfare losses for middle-aged current generations are
only modest. However, such a reform is politically not feasible, since public debt rises

dramatically. Consequently, tax-favored accounts in OECD countries are combined with
limited saving subsidies in order to dampen the initial shortfalls in tax revenues. Our
simulations indicate that such reforms still have a signi?cant impact on capital accumu-
lation in the long run. Depending on the applied policy mix, the latter will rise between
3.5 and 9.6 percent while between 11 and 14 percent of IRA contributions are additional
savings. Despite the positive e?ects on capital accumulation, the aggregate e?ciency
gain is almost insigni?cant for most realistic parameter combinations. This is due to the
fact that lower tax distortions have to be weighted against the reduced insurance proper-
ties of the tax system. With respect to the distributional consequences we ?nd that the
reform will reduce the welfare of elderly generations and increase the welfare of future
generations by roughly 1 percent of their respective remaining lifetime resources. Finally,
with respect to the speci?c saving incentives our simulations indicate that a mixture of
tax deductions and bonuses as applied in Germany may be preferred due to the positive
growth, distributional and e?ciency consequences.
In the next section, we describe how we model the tax and bene?t system and sketch
the structure of the simulation model. Section 3 explains the calibration and simulation
approach. Finally, section 4 presents the simulation results and section 5 o?ers some
concluding remarks.
2 The model economy
2.1 Preliminaries
We consider an economy populated by overlapping generations of individuals which face
random survival up to a maximum possible lifespan of J = 16 periods, i.e. each model
period covers ?ve years. In addition to lifespan uncertainty, individuals also face pro-
ductivity shocks during their working time. Labor supply is variable, but consumers are
forced to retire at the retirement age jR = 9 (i.e. real age 60). During retirement, pen-
sioners receive payroll-?nanced social security bene?ts and run down their accumulated
assets. Apart from the pension system, the government levies a progressive personal tax
on income from labor, capital and pensions as well as proportional taxes on consumption
and corporate pro?ts. Tax revenues are used to ?nance public goods and the interest
payments on public debt. The production sector comprises a constant returns to scale
Cobb-Douglas production function without technological progress and no aggregate un-
certainty.
The initial equilibrium of our model economy is a steady state. Then the policy reform is
3
implemented before the individual productivity of the next period is revealed, and a new
equilibrium path in the closed economy is calculated. We assume zero population growth
and keep the survival probabilities constant at initial values. Consequently, all agents face
a probability sj of surviving up to age j, conditional of surviving up to age j ? 1. Every
age j cohort Nj is fragmented into subgroups ?(zj)Nj where
?
zj
?(zj) = 1 re?ecting their
state zj at a speci?c age j. The state zj = (j, epj, a
R
j , aj, ej) of an age j agent describes
the agent?s earning points for public pension claims epj, tax-favored assets a
R
j , ordinary
asset holdings aj, and individual productivity ej. In the following, we concentrate on the
long run equilibrium and omit the state index zj for every variable whenever possible.
Agents are then only distinguished according to their age j.
2.2 The individual decision problem
Our model assumes a preference structure that is represented by a time-separable, nested
CES utility function. In order to isolate risk aversion from intertemporal substitution, we
follow the approach of Epstein and Zin (1991) and formulate the maximization problem
of a representative consumer at age j and state zj recursively as
V (zj) = max

(1)
where j and cj denote leisure and consumption at age j respectively and the parameter
? represents the rate of time preference. Since lifespan is uncertain, the expected utility
in future periods is weighted with the survival probability sj+1. Productivity ej at each
age j is uncertain and depends on the productivity in the previous period. Consequently,
?(ej+1|ej) denotes the probability to experience productivity ej+1 in the next period if
the current productivity is ej. The parameters ? and ? de?ne the intertemporal elasticity
of substitution between consumption and leisure in di?erent years and the degree of
(relative) risk aversion, respectively. Note that for the special case ? = 1
?
we are back at
the traditional expected utility speci?cation, see Epstein and Zin (1991, 266). The period
utility function is de?ned by
u(cj, j) =
[
(cj)
1? 1
? + ?(j)
1? 1
?
] 1
1? 1? (2)
where ? denotes the intratemporal elasticity of substitution between consumption and
leisure at each age j. Finally, the leisure preference parameter ? is assumed to be age
4
independent. The budget constraint is de?ned as follows:
aj+1 = aj(1 + r) + wj(1? ?j) + pj ? sRj ? T (yj, sRj )? (1 + ? c)cj + bj (3)
with a1 = aJ+1 = 0 and aj ? 0 ? j. In addition to interest income from savings raj,
households receive gross labor income wj = (1?j)w ej during their working period as well
as public pensions pj during retirement. They contribute to or withdraw from tax-favored
accounts sRj and have to pay progressive income taxes T (yj, s
R
j ) which depend on taxable
gross income yj and changes in tax-favored accounts. Due to a contribution ceiling the
average contribution rate for public pensions ?j depends on income. Finally, the price of
consumption goods includes consumption taxes ? c and bj de?nes the accidental bequests
received at age j.
Our model abstracts from annuity markets3. Consequently, private assets of all agents
who died are aggregated and then distributed among all cohorts following an exogenous
age- and productivity dependent distribution scheme ?k(j, ej), i.e.
bj = ?k(j, ej)
J?
j=2
?

(1 + r)[aj(zj) + a

where k ? {u, p}. The age distribution of bequest is computed in the initial steady
state where we assume that the heirs always receive the assets of the generation which
was 25 years older. Within a generation we distinguish a uniform distribution ?u(j, ej)
across di?erent productivity types and a distribution ?p(j, ej) which is proportional to
the current productivity level ej. Inheritances from tax-favored accounts might be due to
a speci?c inheritance tax ? b.

aRj+1 = a

J+1 = 0. (5)
In principle, assets could be withdrawn from the accounts before retirement (i.e. sRj <
0, j < jR). However, preliminary withdrawal might be due to a penalty, which reduces
the liquidity of tax-favored accounts compared to ordinary assets signi?cantly.
In our model we assume that contributions to public pensions are exempted from tax while
the bene?ts are fully taxed. Consequently, taxable gross income yj in (3) is computed
from gross labor income net of pension contributions, capital income (net of a saving
allowance ds) and (after retirement) public pensions net of a ?xed work related allowance
d:
yj = wj(1? ?j) + max[ajr ? ds; 0] + pj ? d. (6)
3This is an important deviation from Riester accounts in Germany.
5
Tax payments T (yj, s
R
j ) depend on gross tax payments T05(yj) net of saving subsidies.
The latter consist of the tax savings from contributions to tax-favored accounts or (for
low income households) a ?xed, age-dependent bonus payment (?Zulage?) Zulj, i.e.
T (yj, s
R
j ) =
??
?
T05(yj)?max[T05(yj)? T05(yj ?min[sRj , s?]);Zulj] if sRj ? 0,
T05(yj ? [1? ?]sRj )? ?sRj if sRj < 0, j < jR,
T05(yj ? sRj ) if sRj < 0, j ? jR.
(7)
As already explained, contributions to tax-favored accounts could only be deducted up
to a limit which amounts to s?. Early withdrawals from tax-favored accounts might be
subject to a penalty which amounts to ? percent of the withdrawal. The remaining fraction
has to be fully taxed. According to (7) tax savings depend on individual contributions
to tax-favored accounts sRj and the marginal tax rate. For low income households the
direct bonus payment might be higher. The latter is de?ned as a a hump-shaped age-
dependent transfer scheme trj over the household life-cycle which is computed based on
the ?nal German bonus scheme4. Full bonus payments are only received if savings exceed
a ?xed share ? of individual gross labor income wj. In order to omit that bonuses exceed
savings in tax-favored accounts, we restrict the maximum bonus payment to 95 percent of
savings5. For contributions below the threshold, bonus payments are cut proportionally.
Therefore, we have
Zulj =
{
min[trj, 0.95s

j ] if s
R
j ? ?wj,
min[

2.3 The production side
The economy is populated by a large number of competitive ?rms, the sum of which we
normalize to unity. Aggregate output Y is produced using a Cobb-Douglas production
technology, i.e.
Y = K?L1?? (9)
where K and L are aggregate capital and labor, ? is capital?s share in production, and 
is a technology parameter. Firms have to pay corporate taxes T k = ? k
[
Y ? wL ? ?K]
where the corporate tax rate ? k of 15 percent is applied to the output net of labor costs
wL and depreciation ?K.
4In and after 2008 a household will receive 185 e per child and 154 e per adult person.
5In Germany the government has speci?ed speci?c minimum saving amounts which depend on the
family structure.
6
Firms will employ labor up to the point where the marginal product of labor equals labor
costs. Similarly they will employ capital up to the point where the net marginal product
of capital is equal to the interest rate:

2.4 The government
In each period the government issues new debt ?B and collects taxes and social security
contributions from households and ?rms in order to ?nance general government expendi-
tures G as well as interest payments on its debt:
?B+

[T (y(zj), s
R(zj))+?
cc(zj)+?
b(1+r)aR(zj)(1?sj)/sj]?(zj)Nj+T k = G+rB.
(12)
With respect to public debt, we assume initially that the government maintains an ex-
ogenously ?xed debt to output ratio. General government expenditures G consist of gov-
ernment purchases of goods and services which are ?xed per capita. In order to balance
the budget we adjust the consumption tax rate ? c.
In each year, the pension system pays old-age bene?ts and collects payroll contributions
from wage income below the contribution ceiling which is ?xed at two times the average
income w?. Individual pension bene?ts pj of a retiree of age j ? jR in a speci?c year
are computed from the product of his earning points epjR the retiree has accumulated at
retirement and the actual pension amount (APA) of the respective year:
pj = epjR ? APA. (13)
The accumulated earning points depend on the relative income position min[wj/w?; 2] of
the worker at working age j < jR. Since the contribution ceiling is ?xed at the double
of average income, the maximum earning points that could be collected per year are 2.
Accumulated earning points at age j are therefore
epj = epj?1 +min[wj/w?; 2]. (14)
The budget of the pension system must be balanced in each period. Therefore, the general
contribution rate ? has to be adjusted to ful?ll the period budget constraint

The right hand side of equation (15) shows the individual contribution base. Households
don?t pay contribution on income above the contribution ceiling. Note that the general
social security contribution rate ? which is calculated from (15) is not necessarily identical
with the individual contribution rates in the budget constraint (3). The latter is given by
?j =
{
? if wj ? 2w?,
?2w?/wj if wj > 2w?.
(16)
3 Calibration
In order to solve the model we have to specify the income process, preference and techno-
logy parameters and tax rates. This section presents our parameter choices and describes
the initial equilibrium.6
3.1 The income process
We consider six productivity pro?les across the life cycle. The four top pro?les are directly
taken from Fehr (1999) while the lowest pro?le from the previous study has been split up
in order to improve the income distribution. When an agent enters the labor market (at
age 20-24) he belongs to the lowest productivity level with a probability of 10 percent, to
the second lowest again with 10 percent and to higher levels with 20 percent, respectively.
After the initial period, agents change their productivity levels according to the following
Markov transition matrix.
Table 1: Markov transition matrix
Current productivity level
1 2 3 4 5 6
1 0.40 0.24 0.17 0.09 0.05 0.04

6 0.04 0.03 0.05 0.06 0.20 0.63

SOEP data
6This section as well as subsection 4.1 follows closely Fehr and Habermann (2005).

The Markov transition matrix is calculated as follows: First the primary earners in each
household of the 1998 survey are ranked according to their gross income and then divided
into six income classes. Then we rank and compute the respective income class of those
persons who are still in the survey in 2003. Finally we calculate the above reported
transition probabilities for each income class.
3.2 Preferences, technology, demographics and bequest
Table 2 reports the other important parameter values. Except the coe?cient of relative
risk aversion, all preference and technology parameters are taken from Auerbach and
Kotliko? (1987, 52f.) as well as Fehr (1999, 57). Values between 1 and 5 for ? are
typically perceived as reasonable in the literature, see Cecchetti et al. (2000, 792) for a
discussion. The technology level is chosen in order to normalize labor income.

age of retirement (model age jR = 9) 60-64

The actual pension amount (APA) in equation (13) is computed in order to yield a
standard pension (i.e. where epjR = jR?1) which amounts to sixty percent of net average
earnings w?n.
The taxation of gross income (from labor, capital and pensions) is close to the current
German income tax code and the marginal tax rate schedule introduced in 2005. Conse-
quently, after the basic allowance of 7800 e the marginal tax rate rises linearly from 15
9
to maximum of 42 percent when taxable income y passes 52.000 e. We assume that our
individuals are married couples with a sole wage earner and apply the German income
splitting method. For capital income there is a special allowance of ds = 1800 e (per
couple)7.
Finally, with respect to the demographic parameters we compute average survival proba-
bilities from Bomsdorf (2003) for the ages 20 to 99 as shown in Table A.1 in the appendix
as well as the intergenerational bequest distribution.
3.3 Initial equilibrium
Table 3 reports the structure of the models initial equilibrium without tax-favored accounts
and compares it with the respective ?gures in 2004 for Germany. All in all, the model
represents the basic economic and ?scal structure of Germany quite well. Since the model
is simulated as a closed economy, the interest rate is endogenous and the trade balance is
zero. The key characteristics of the tax and pension system match the current German
situation.
We have assumed in the benchmark equilibrium that inheritances are distributed uni-
formly within a generation (i.e. ?u). If we distribute inheritances proportional to the
individual productivity, the inequality of the wealth distribution increases as well as ag-
gregate savings. Consequently, the capital-output ratio is slightly higher at 3.3 while the
interest rate slightly decreases to 2.7 percent. The structure of the tax and bene?t system,
however, is hardly a?ected by the distribution of inheritances.
Table 4 shows the distribution for net income and assets respectively. The percentage
share of income (assets) is the share that accrues to subgroups of the population ranked
by net income (assets). Our initial equilibrium replicates the German income distribu-
tion quite well, however, as usual, it underestimates the wealth inequality8. As already
noted above, the proportional distribution of inheritances deteriorates the wealth distri-
bution in the model. However, since rich (poor) households work less (more), the income
distribution becomes more equal.
Finally, 10 percent of labor market entrants (i.e. the lowest income class) would like to
borrow on the capital market in the initial equilibrium. For the following generations this
fraction falls to 9, 7, 5 and 2 percent, respectively.
This should su?ce to explain our calibration and initial equilibrium. Next we turn to the
7In Germany this allowance is currently 3000 e for nominal interest income, but in our model we
have no in?ation and therefore we reduce this amount by about 40 percent.
8Heer and Trede (2003, 96) point out that this might be due to the neglected business ownership.

4 Simulation results
This section compares the macroeconomic and welfare consequences of the introduction
of tax-favored accounts. Before the numerical results of the simulations are presented, we
?rst explain the computation of the welfare changes.
4.1 Experimental design and social welfare
The welfare criterion we use to assess this reform is ex-ante expected utility of an agent,
before the productivity level is revealed (i.e. looking upon her life behind the Rawlsian veil
of ignorance). For an agent who enters the labor market the expected utility is computed
from
V =
[
6?
i=1
?iV
1??
i
] 1
1??
where ?1 = ?2 = 0.1 and ?3 = ? ? ? = ?6 = 0.2. From that point of view one has some
desire for redistribution, which provides insurance for being born as a low-productivity
type. Following Auerbach and Kotliko? (1987, 87) we compute the proportional increase
in consumption and leisure (W ) which would make an agent in the baseline scenario as
well o? as in the reform scenario. If the expected utility level after the reform is V? and
the expected utility level on the baseline path is V? , the necessary increase (decrease) in
percent of initial resources is computed from
W =
[(
V?
V?
)
? 1
]
? 100. (17)
Consequently, a value of W = 1.0 indicates that this agent would need one percent more
resources in the baseline scenario to attain expected utility V? .
In order to asses the aggregate e?ciency consequences, we introduce a Lump-Sum Redis-
tribution Authority (LSRA) in the spirit of Auerbach and Kotliko? (1987, 65f.) as well
as Nishiyama and Smetters (2005) or Fehr and Habermann (2005). The LSRA pays a
lump-sum transfer (or levies a lump-sum tax) to each living household in the ?rst pe-
riod of the transition to bring their expected utility level back to the level of the initial
equilibrium. Since utility depends on age and state, these transfers (or taxes) have to
be computed for every agent in period one. Note that transfers di?er only between the
states of the earning points epj and asset holdings aj and a
R
j but not between e?ciencies
for agents with the same epj, aj and a

j . That is because the reform is announced before
the productivity shock in period 1 is revealed. Consequently, age-j agents who already
worked before the reform are compensated by the transfers v1(zj, V? (zj)), which guaranties
12
for each individual at state zj the initial expected utility level V? (zj). On the other hand,
those who enter the labor market in period t of the transition receive a transfer v1t(V
?)
which guaranties them an expected utility level V ?. Note that the transfers v1t may di?er
among future cohorts but the expected utility level V ? is identical for all. The value of
the latter is chosen by requiring that the present value of all LSRA transfers is zero:

With V ? > V? (i.e. W > 0), all households in period one who have lived in the previous
period would be as well o? as before the reform and all current and future newborn
households would be strictly better o?. Hence, the new policy is Pareto improving after
lump-sum redistributions. With V ? < V? (i.e. W < 0), the policy reform is Pareto inferior
after lump-sum redistributions. In order to asses the overall e?ciency of the reform we
will report the value of W after compensation in the following tables.
4.2 The benchmark reform experiment
In order to ?x the economic intuition, we apply our model ?rst to a stylized reform
experiment which has been never implemented in practice. In this benchmark simulation
we assume that it is possible to subtract an unlimited amount from the income tax and
save it in the tax-favored accounts (i.e. s? = ?). There are no bonus payments (i.e.
? = ?) and no penalties for early withdrawal (i.e. ? = 0.0). In order to guarantee a
complete taxation at the time of withdrawal we assume that the speci?c inheritance tax
rate is equal to the aggregate marginal income tax rate (i.e. ? b = 0.17). Table 5 reports
the macroeconomic consequences of this benchmark reform.
Since current assets are equal to savings from the previous period, the capital stock is ?xed
in the reform period and we report the changes of the second period in the ?rst line of
Table 5. Right after the introduction of tax-favored accounts households shift their liquid
assets and additional savings into these accounts in order to balance marginal tax rates
over the life cycle and reduce their tax burden. Since many elderly and poor individuals
have no incentive to accumulate in the new accounts and rich households will only balance
their marginal tax rates, the initial share of IRAs in total assets only amounts to slightly
more than one third. About ( 6
1.06?34 =) 16.6 percent of IRAs consist of new savings, the
rest is diverted from the already existing ordinary savings accounts. The IRA savings
decrease aggregate income tax revenues as well as private consumption. Consequently, in
order to balance the budget the consumption tax rate has to increase by 9.8 percentage
points initially. Labor supply and employment increases due to the reduced marginal tax

burden on labor income, while wages have to decrease slightly in order to balance the
labor market.
During the transition, the rising capital stock increases bequests and induces higher wages
while the interest rate falls slightly. Consequently, aggregate consumption rises and con-
sumption tax rates decrease even below the original level. In the long run, the aggregate
capital stock increases by almost 22 percentage points and the consumption tax rate is
reduced by more than one percentage point. The share of tax-favored assets in total
assets (IRA share) increases steadily since younger households tend to save heavily in the
new accounts. On ?rst sight it might be surprising that in the long run not all savings
are accumulated in the tax-favored accounts. However, those individuals who expect a
high tax rate in retirement but face a lower marginal tax rate while working will save
predominantly in ordinary accounts. In addition, poor households might be indi?erent
since their asset returns are below the speci?c savings allowance.
Next we consider the welfare changes for speci?c cohorts computed from equation (17) as
well as the aggregate e?ciency consequences of the benchmark reform in Figure 19. Not
surprisingly, the initial consumption tax increase especially hurts the elderly households,
since they don?t bene?t from the income tax deductions. The welfare losses for the oldest
generations amounts to more than four percent of their remaining resources. Welfare losses
decrease with falling age since younger households can take advantage of tax deductions,
experience higher wages and face lower consumption taxes. Those who enter the labor

market in the reform period (i.e. year of birth is 1985) still face a welfare loss due to the
reform, but younger generations will gain up to 2.5 percent of their resources.

Figure 1 also shows that the considered benchmark reform would yield a slight Pareto-
improvement. If all current households are compensated by LSRA transfers as described
above, young and future households could still experience a welfare increase which amounts
to 0.22 percent of initial resources. The aggregate e?ciency gain is due to the induced
changes in tax distortions and insurance properties of the tax system. As Nishiyama and
Smetters (2005) have already shown, a reform towards consumption taxation will reduce
tax distortions but also deteriorate the insurance properties of the tax system. In order to
improve the economic intuition, Table 6 reports some sensitivity calculations for the ag-
gregate e?ciency e?ects of the considered benchmark reform. If we eliminate the taxation
of inheritances, the aggregate e?ciency gain increases from 0.22 percent to 0.37 percent.
On ?rst sight this is counterintuitive since the inheritance tax is a lump-sum tax so that
its elimination increases tax distortions. However, uniformly distributed bequests serve
as a insurance device against income shocks. Consequently, the elimination of inheritance
taxes improves the insurance properties which in turn dominates the increased tax dis-
tortions. When bequests are distributed proportionally, they can?t serve as an insurance
device. Consequently, since the positive insurance e?ects from the higher bequests are
missing in the left column, the reform yields an aggregate e?ciency loss. If inheritance
taxation is eliminated now, the aggregate e?ciency losses rise due to the increased tax
distortions.
Of course, the (negative) insurance e?ects of the reform are eliminated if we simulate
the reform with risk neutral agents. Consequently, aggregate e?ciency rises signi?cantly
in the right part of Table 6. With the same reasoning, aggregate e?ciency decreases, if

we simulate the reform now without inheritance taxation. Finally, a lower intertempo-
ral elasticity of substitution will also slightly dampen the reduction in tax distortions.
Consequently, aggregate e?ciency in the last column is lower than in the previous one.
4.3 Policy reforms with endogenous debt
Due to the variation of the endogenous consumption tax rate, the benchmark reform of the
previous section induced a signi?cant intergenerational redistribution. In order to dampen
the latter, this subsection considers an alternative reform strategy which implements a
constant consumption tax rate to balance the intertemporal budget constraint of the
government. Periodical shortfalls or surpluses of tax revenues are balanced by adjustments
of public debt.
In the ?rst simulation introduces tax-favored accounts as in the previous subsection. This
form of retirement saving taxation is also called front-loaded. Since the exemption of
savings returns from tax is only one form of expenditure taxation, the second simulation
introduces back-loaded IRAs where contributions are not tax deductible but withdrawals
are tax free. Since we abstract from any restrictions on contributions and withdrawals,
back-loaded IRAs are identical to a preannounced elimination of interest taxation (i.e.
ds = ? in equation (6)). Table 7 compares the long run impact of the two considered
reforms and the respective e?ciency consequences.
With front-loaded IRAs, the consumption tax rate has to be increased immediately by
2.6 percentage points right after the reform. Since this does not su?ce to balance the
revenue shortfalls, the government accumulates public debt which rises (from 60 per cent
of GDP initially) up to 146 percent of GDP. As before, tax-favored accounts reduce the
tax burden of middle-aged and elderly. Consequently, they save more and transfer more
to their descendants. However, due to the increase in public debt capital accumulation is
much weaker than before. Of course, the latter dampens the long run growth in consump-
tion, output and wages. Note that the aggregate e?ciency gains are now higher than in

the benchmark since intertemporal distortions from the ?uctuating consumption tax are
eliminated.
In contrast, a preannounced elimination of capital income taxation would increase the
consumption tax rate only by 1.1 percentage point throughout the transition. Since
individuals can?t reduce their tax burdens on labor income with higher savings10, the
capital accumulation is weaker than before. On the other hand, back-loaded IRAs allow
to reduce public debt in the long run slightly to 59.5 percent of GDP. Consequently,
aggegate savings increase less than the capital stock. Finally, due to the still high marginal
tax burdens on labor income aggregate e?ciency gains are dampened compared to the
previous simulation.
Figure 2 compares the intergenerational welfare consequences of the two reform strategies
with the benchmark case. Note ?rst that now the losses of the elderly are much smaller
than before. In the case of debt-?nanced front-loaded IRAs, pension bene?ts increase
initially due to higher labor supply. Consequently, higher consumption taxes now reduce
mainly the welfare of young retirees by about 0.5 percent of their resources. Younger
generations bene?t from higher inheritances, wages and better tax arbitrage opportunities.
The introduction of debt-?nanced back-loaded IRAs reduces the welfare of elderly only

necessarily increase savings, see Ragan (1994).

slightly since they bene?t directly from the elimination of capital income taxes. The
latter almost balances the loss from the increased consumption tax rate. Young and
future generations bene?t again due to higher wages.

Since both reforms considered above eliminate the taxation of capital income with a
constant consumption tax rate, the literature often highlights the equivalence of these
two forms of expenditure taxation, see Meade (1978, 153). In the present model, the
di?erence between front-loaded and back-loaded IRAs in terms of their macroeconomic
and welfare consequences is mainly due to the progressive income tax system and the
di?erences in the timing and the pattern of tax payments. If we assume a proportional
income tax, a small open economy and phase-in the introduction of both reforms (i.e.
only the young in each period are allowed to open an IRA) we obtain the equivalence
result cited in the literature. However, in practice, back-loaded and front-loaded IRAs
are not equivalent due to these restrictions.
Summing up this subsection we conclude that a de?cit-?nanced introduction of front-
loaded IRAs would only modestly hurt currently living generations and increase the
growth and e?ciency gains compared to the benchmark simulation. However, since the
debt level rises enormously, such a reform is not viable in practice. Consequently, in the
following subsection we return to the constant debt assumption of the benchmark and
consider more realistic institutional arrangements which limit revenue shortfalls and the
intergenerational redistribution.
18
4.4 Penalties, contribution ceilings and bonus payments
As already explained above, the withdrawal from the accounts is usually restricted in
various ways. For example in Germany, savers have to pay back their tax savings on
balances which are withdrawn before age 60 and have to convert their assets into annuities
after retirement. Other countries such as the US apply an early withdrawal penalty which
severely lowers the liquidity of the tax-favored accounts. In addition, in order to limit
revenue shortfalls, countries allow tax deduction only up to a speci?c contribution ceiling.
Finally, some special special arrangements such as bonus payments in Germany might be
provided for low income households. In the following simulations we always assume the
most extreme case, where early withdrawal is not possible at all (i.e. ? = 1.0). Table 8
then compares saving incentives in the form of unlimited or limited tax deductions with
other systems were direct bonus payments are applied.
The ?rst simulation only introduces withdrawal restrictions but keeps the benchmark val-
ues for the remaining parameters. When the liquidity of the tax-favored accounts during
the working phase is eliminated, people will save less in these accounts. Consequently,
compared to the benchmark case in Table 5 the capital accumulation is now dampened,
and the IRA share is signi?cantly lower. On the other hand, employment and wages
still rise by 0.8 and 4.5 percent, respectively, in the long run and the consumption tax
rate increases initially by 7.8 percentage points. Due to the reduced initial increase of
the consumption tax rate, the intergenerational redistribution is dampened. The oldest
generations now lose less then 4 percent of their remaining lifetime resources and the
future generations gain less than 2 percent. On the other hand, aggregate e?ciency gains
increase slightly from 0.22 to 0.30 percent. Of course, liquidity restrictions reduce the
e?ciency of the resource allocation. However, they also restrict the shift from the pro-
gressive income tax to the consumption tax. The latter improves the insurance properties
of the tax system and, consequently, aggregate e?ciency rises11.
Next we consider the introduction of contribution limits. The ceiling of 2100 e in Ger-
many amounts to roughly 8 percent of average gross earnings. Contribution limits signi?-
cantly reduce the tax arbitrage opportunities for rich households. Their marginal tax rate
for labor income either remains constant (if they are in the top tax bracket) or declines
only slightly compared to the previous simulation. In addition, if they save more than
the contribution ceiling, their e?ective marginal tax rate on savings is not a?ected by the
reform. Consequently, the long-run IRA savings only amount to 40 percent of aggregate
11If we introduce withdrawal restrictions when individuals are risk neutral, aggregate e?ciency de-
creases signi?cantly.

savings and the capital stock increases by 5.6 percent12. The consumption tax has to be
increased by 1.8 percentage points initially and falls in the long run slightly below the
original level. Since marginal income tax rates hardly change for many rich households
but consumption taxes increase initially, e?ciency gains fall signi?cantly compared to
the previous simulation. The considered reform now yields an aggregate e?ciency loss of
about 0.1 percent of aggregate resources.
A doubling of the contribution limit has a signi?cant e?ect on capital accumulation and

20
GDP. Aggregate e?ciency, however, is hardly a?ected since (positive) tax incentive and
(negative) insurance e?ects balance on aggregate.
While contribution ceilings mainly a?ect the saving decision of wealthy individuals, bonus
payments are an attractive incentive for low income households. In Germany, the age-
dependent bonus scheme roughly amounts to the tax savings of an average income house-
hold if he contributes 4 percent of his income to the tax-favored account. As reported
in the forth column of Table 8, with our speci?c calibration bonus payments are cheaper
in terms of forgone tax revenues than contribution limits but also induce lower growth
e?ects for capital stock and employment. Aggregate e?ciency gains are slightly positive,
since bonus payments can be viewed as an insurance device for low income households.
Increasing the required contribution for full bonuses from 4 to 8 percent of individual
income reduces the incentive to accumulate capital. This in turn leads to a lower con-
sumption taxes during transition. The IRA share, on the other hand, is hardly a?ected
since households shift resources from their ordinary savings accounts into tax-favored ac-
counts. Nevertheless, aggregate e?ciency slightly increases to 0.12 percent of aggregate
resources due to lower consumption taxes.
Finally, we simulate a mixed incentive system which resembles the German setting de-
scribed above. Depending on the individual advantage of the respective subsidy, house-
holds either receive bonus payments or tax deductions up to the contribution ceiling.
Since this mixture combines saving incentives both for low and top income households,
the induced growth e?ects for the capital stock are higher than in the respective reforms
were either limited tax deductions or bonus payments are applied. Aggregate e?ciency
is almost zero in this case.
Next we consider in Figure 3 the intergenerational welfare consequences of tax deductions
with contribution limits (s? = 0.08w?) and bonus payments (? = 0.04). Compared to the
benchmark in Figure 1, the intergenerational redistribution in now very modest. The
oldest generations lose roughly one percent of their remaining resources, while future
generations gain less than one percent. Due to the strongest initial consumption tax
increase, the mixed reform reduces welfare of elderly the most. Since employment rises
in the case of contribution ceilings while it falls with bonus payments, pensions increase
slightly in the former case while they fall in the latter. Consequently, elderly are slightly
better of with contribution ceilings than with bonus payments. In the long run, the
mixed system generates the strongest wage growth so that future generations are better
o? compared to the two other scenarios.
In order to shed more light on the di?erence between tax deductions and bonus payments,
we compare in Figure 4 the welfare consequences for di?erent productivity types of the

generation that enters the labor market in the reform period (i.e. year of birth 1985 in
Figure 3). As one would expect, low productivity individuals bene?t much stronger from
bonus payments than from tax deductions. For top productivity households the di?erence
is negligible, due to the risk of becoming a low productivity type in the future.

In the long run, the relative advantage of the di?erent subsidy instrument changes. As
Figure 5 shows, now the mixed system is better for low productivity types due to the
higher wages.
Concluding this subsection our simulations therefore indicate that although bonus pay-
ments are an e?cient means for low income households even the latter would opt for a
mixed system in the long run.

5 Conclusion
The present paper develops a general equilibrium model with idiosyncratic labor income
risk in order to analyze the introduction of tax-favored individual retirement accounts.
We ?nd that the currently implemented reforms will have a signi?cant impact on capital
accumulation in the long run, but only yield very minor aggregate e?ciency gains. The
main bene?ciaries are future generations while current middle-aged and elderly are hurt
by the reform. The latter is due to the fact that existing cohorts mainly have to bear the
burden from higher consumption taxes while young and future generations bene?t from
lower tax burdens and higher future wages.
We also show that withdrawal penalties only have a minor impact on the macroeconomy.
While tax deductions are mainly bene?cial for top income households, low income house-
holds can be e?ectively subsidized with direct bonus payments. In the long run, however,
even low income households prefer a mixture of direct bonuses and tax deductions since
the latter increases wages stronger.
Of course, the present framework could be extended in various other directions. In fu-
ture work we plan to extend our model in order to analyze the e?ciency of additional
subsidy instruments for retirement savings, mandatory savings accounts and the required
annuitization of retirement income.

Computational Method
The state of a household is determined by zj = (j, epj, a
R
j , aj, ej) ? J ?P ?AR ?A? E
where J = {1, . . . , J},P = {ep1, . . . , epnP },AR = {aR,1, . . . , aR,nR},A = {a1, . . . , anA}
and E = {e1, . . . , enE} are discrete sets. In this paper we use nJ = 16, np = 5, nR =
12, nA = 12 and nE = 6. For all these possible states zj we compute the optimal decision
of households from (1).
Since u(cj, j) is not di?erentiable in every (cj, j) and V (zj+1) is only known in a discrete
set of points zj+1 ? {j + 1} ? P ? AR ? A ? E , this maximization problem can not be
solved analytically. Therefore we have to use the following numerical maximization and
interpolation algorithms to compute households optimal decision:
1. Compute (1) in age J for all possible zJ . Notice that V (zJ+1) = 0 and households are
not allowed to work anymore. Hence, in the optimum households should consume
everything they have.
2. For j = J ? 1, . . . , 1:

Find (1) for all possible zj by using Powell?s algorithm (Press et. al. (2001, 406?.),
Acton (1990, 464?.)). Since this algorithm requires a continuous function, we have
to interpolate V (zj+1). Having computed the data V (zj+1) for all zj+1 ? {j +
1} ? P ? AR ?A? E in the last step, we can now ?nd functions sp(j+1),k for each
productivity level ek ? E which satisfy the interpolation conditions

for all l = 1, . . . , nP , m = 1, . . . , nR and n = 1, . . . , nA. In this paper we use
multidimensional cubic spline interpolation, i.e. sj,k : S3 ? S3 ? S3 ? R, whereas
S3 is the space of all one-dimensional, twice continuously di?erentiable, piecewise
third-order polynomial functions and S3 ? S3 ? S3 its tensor product (cf. Judd
(1998, 225?.)). Further information is available upon request, see Habermann and
Kindermann (2006). The multidimensional cubic spline interpolation allows a re-
duction of nP , nR and nA to only a few points with the same accuracy as multilinear
interpolation.
Having computed the data V (zj) for all zj we can now approach like I?mrohorog?lu et. al.
(1995).
