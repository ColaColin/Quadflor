ABSTRACT 
 
Distributional Consequences of Capital Accumulation, 
Globalisation and Financialisation in the US* 
 
In this paper we examine the dynamic contributions of capital accumulation, globalisation, 
and financialisation to the functional-personal income distribution nexus. We analyse the 
labour share under the prism of monopoly and frictional growth, and disclose the dramatic 
upward trend in inequality. On this basis, we estimate a two-equation model for the income 
distribution in the US over the 1960-2009 period. We show that the labour share is affected 
positively by capital intensity and negatively by trade, while the Gini statistic is fueled by the 
falling labour share and increasing financial payments. Using counterfactual simulations, a 
key finding is that the decrease in capital intensity in the eighties accounted for about 76% of 
the labour share fall, while its increase in the 2000s prevented inequality from worsening 
three times more than it actually did. In turn, had financialisation not increased after 2005, 
inequality would have decreased to its level in the early noughties. In the Great Recession 
years of tense socioeconomic conditions, looking at income distribution through the lens of 
the wage-productivity gap could enlighten economic policy.

1 Introduction
For the last three decades, the personal and functional distributions of income have fol-
lowed divergent trends in the US. While increasing inequality in personal income distribu-
tion has been pushing the Gini index relentlessly upwards, the evolution in the functional
distribution of income has been characterised by a downward trend in the labour income
share (Figure 1).1 Since the labour income share can also be envisaged as the wage-
productivity gap, its downward trend is a mere reflection of wages lagging further behind
labour productivity.
The aim of this paper is to identify the driving forces of the wage-productivity gap and
inequality, and evaluate their consequences for the functional-personal income distribution
nexus.

In earlier work we argued that the falling labour share is a long-run structural phe-
nomenon due to the interplay of wage dynamics and productivity growth, i.e. frictional
growth.2 More emphatically, the wage gap does not vanish even when the classical as-
sumption of a unitary long-run elasticity of wages with respect to productivity holds. In
this paper we take a step forward and argue that the interplay between lags and growth
can be detected in the theory of economic dynamics in Kalecki ([1954]2009). Understand-
ing the wage-productivity gap as a structural development paves the way for the analysis
of its e?ects on economic activity.
An initial phase of our enquiry showed that the falling labour share is an important
channel increasing personal income inequality and supporting employment. This led us
to evaluate what we call the inequality-employment sensitivity ratio (Karanassou and
1The rise in income inequality has been documented by, among others, Atkinson, Piketty and Saez
(2011), Saez (2010), Piketty and Saez (2006), and Wol? and Zacharias (2006). For the labour share time
path and its determinants see, for example, Milberg and Winkler (2010a), Stockhammer (2009), IMF
(2007), and Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003).

Sala and D.J. Snower in their work since 2005.

Sala, 2012),3 which can be seen as a barometer of the two-sided role of the falling labour
share in economic activity: wider wage gaps are associated with lower unit labour costs
that boost employment and, at the same time, they further lead to the squeeze of the
middle class by overloading its socioeconomic burden. In e?ect, the employment support
of the falling labour share, from the 1970s to the late 2000s, "sweetened" its distributional
impact and diverted attention away from the issue of increasing inequality.
Since this employment/wage gap finding is consistent with the view that wages drive
employment and employment drives output expansion (growth), it is important to clarify
our position on this respect. In their thorough analytical exposition, Bhaduri and Marglin
(1990) associated the negative relation between real wages and employment with a profit-
led expansion obtained by profit maximisation or, alternatively, when ?aggregate demand
is higher owing to the strong response of investment to the higher profit margin/share
brought about by a lower real wage rate? (ib., p.379). Projecting on the same argument,
the reverse case of a wage-led expansion can be derived: employment (output) contracts
at a lower real wage due to the relatively weak response of investment to the higher profit
margin/share.
While our work is in accordance with the inverse relation between real wages and
employment, prepounded by Keynes in the General Theory and endorsed by the neo-
classical school of thought, it refutes the conventional wisdom that the labour income share
is neutral to the performance of macro-labour markets. It may be tantalising to place the
finding of an inverse relation between the wage-productivity gap and employment along
the lines of a profit-led growth model. However, in the light of the financial developments
and high personal borrowing of recent decades, the scenarios of wage-led and profit-led
growth/demand need to be reassessed.
They need to accommodate the fact that while wages have been lagging further behind
productivity, spending has kept up with output by the expansion of consumer debt - the
ratio of household debt to GDP jumped from 75% in 2000 to 104% in 2007 (BIS, 2009).
While we have been witnessing a falling labour share accompanied by rising personal debt,
profits have been increasing without being reinvested. For example, Reuters (2010, April
15) reports that ?The Fortune 500 largest U.S. companies slashed a record 821,000 jobs last
year, even as their collective profit soared more than three-fold to $391 billion, according
to the business magazine?. Martin Wolf in the Financial Times (2008, February 5) notes:
?the profits of financial companies jumped from below 5 per cent of total corporate profits,
after tax, in 1982 to 41 per cent in 2007, even though their share of corporate value added
only rose from 8 per cent to 16 per cent.? Our thesis has thus been confined to the analysis
3The negative relation between the labour share and inequality is also documented by Checchi and
Garc?a-Pe?alosa (2010) in their regression of the Gini statistic. Giovannoni (2010) argues that the high-
quality datasets by the UTIP-UNIDO and the OECD-SULCI clearly show a strong link between the
lower wage share and higher inequality since 1980.

of the role of the wage gap in the income distribution nexus. It is beyond the scope of
this paper to examine whether our presumed profit-led result is due to a strong response
of investment to higher profits, or rather to a relatively weak response of investment to
higher profits in conjunction with a debt-driven demand.
This work shows that the central determinants of the labour share and the Gini co-
e?cient are capital intensity, trade (or the degree of openness), and financial payments.
These variables are regarded as reasonably good proxies of the critical macroeconomic
phenomena of capital accumulation, globalisation, and financialisation. The later refers
to the engagement of the non-financial sector (global/oligopolistic industries) in financial
markets.4
Estimating a two-equation system over the 1960-2009 period, we find that (i) the
functional income distribution is mainly driven by the capital intensity and trade factors,
and (ii) inequality is fueled by the falling labour share and increasing financial payments.
Put di?erently, while there is a direct e?ect of financialisation on the personal income
distribution, capital accumulation and globalisation a?ect inequality indirectly via the
labour share. In addition, it can be argued that capital intensity is the transmission
channel of financialisation to the functional income distribution.
On the basis of the statistical significance and adequacy of our model, we measure its
economic significance by evaluating the distributional consequences of capital intensity,
trade, and financial payments. To this end we carry out counterfactual simulations over
selected time spans after 1980 that answer the question: How have the ups and downs of
these three variables contributed to the evolution of the labour share and the Gini index?
The results are revealing. The positive e?ect of capital accumulation on the labour share
has been a vital force in the distributional developments throughout the decades. On the
other hand, financialisation is a key factor to increasing inequality.
Regarding the personal income distribution, had capital accumulation remained at its
low value in 2000 for the rest of the noughties (rather than increasing), income inequality
would have worsened three times more than it actually did. In contrast, had financial-
isation stayed as low as its 2005 value during the second half of the decade (instead of
accelerating), the Gini coe?cient would have fallen back to its level in 2000. Prior to
2000, the slowdown in capital intensity led to significantly more inequality which was
reinforced by the increases in financialisation. Furthermore, the higher degree of open-
ness contributed to ease inequality, albeit by less than one percentage point (pp) in each
decade.
Regarding the functional income distribution, while the decrease in capital accumu-
lation was the biggest contributor to the widening wage gap during the eighties and the

Karanassou (2011).

nineties, the higher capital intensity in the 2000s prevented the labour share from falling
by an extra 2.8 pp. On the other hand, and although the labour share e?ect of the trade
factor was rather small in the previous decades, the labour share would have stabilised at
its year 2000 value had trade not increased in the noughties.
Section 2 presents the functional income distribution under the prism of the degree
of monopoly and frictional growth. Section 3 discusses the measures of inequality and
comments on the steep upward trend of the personal income distribution since the eighties.
Section 4 outlines the labour share and Gini coe?cient relations of our empirical model,
while Section 5 presents the estimation results. Having identified capital accumulation,
globalisation, and financialisation as the driving forces of the labour share and inequality,
Section 6 evaluates their distributional consequences. Finally, Section 7 concludes.
2 Functional Income Distribution
In the context of our work, it is important to stress that the labour income share is in
e?ect the wage share, which through the wage-productivity relationship can be seen as
the wage gap:
labour share ? wages
GDP
=
wages/employees
GDP/employees
=
avg. wage
productivity
? wage gap. (1)
If, say, a 10% productivity gain is accompanied by a 10% growth in the average real
wage, then the wage gap is zero (i.e. the labour share is stable). On the other hand, the
lower the wage growth, the more wages trail productivity gains and thus the wider is the
wage gap (i.e. the lower is the labour share). Milberg and Winkler (2010b) point out
that the labour share is a good indicator of economic insecurity as it reflects both labour
demand and wage changes. Milberg and Sch?ller (2009, p.20) note that the labour share
has not fallen as much as in other countries ?partly due to the fact that the large levels of
CEO compensation in the U.S., including stock options, are o?cially accounted in labor
income.?
Figure 1 shows that the labour share fell by 13% from 1960 to 2009. At the same
time, the evidence provided by Foster, McChesney, and Jonna (2011, p.5) suggests that
economic concentration increased sharply during the same period. Following Kalecki?s
study we argue that the widening wage-productivity gap signifies the increasing power of
a monopolistic environment over competitive markets.

2.1 Falling Labour Shares and the Degree of Monopoly: The
Kalecki Argument
To a large extent, the reality verdict of a falling labour share, globalisation and the ensuing
concentration in corporate power since the 1970s echoes the work of Kalecki ([1954]2009)
who conclusively argued that ?The degree of monopoly has a general tendency to increase
in the long run and thus to depress the relative share of wages in income...? (ib., p.30)
The most profound factor driving monopoly power is the promotion of giant corporations
and the concomitant price fixing. The substantial share in an industry?s output of such a
firm implies that (i) its price can significantly influence the average price, and (ii) other
firms will follow since their price is a function of the average price. As the game of setting
the price at a higher level than otherwise is also played by other big firms, the end result
is a rise in the degree of monopoly.
Here is a synopsis of Kalecki?s theory on price formation in an industry and the relation
between the degree of monopoly and the wage share. Let the price of the firm, ?? be a
function of the unit prime cost (i.e. wages and the cost of primary products), ?? and
the weighted average price of all firms (?) : ? = ?? + ??, where the coe?cients ? and
? are associated with price-fixing and reflect what Kalecki calls the degree of monopoly
of the firm?s position. Consequently, the increase of ?
1?? ? ? captures a higher degree
of monopoly. Expanding the analysis from the firm level to the industry level, it can be
shown that the average price is proportionate to the average unit cost for a given degree
of monopoly: ? = ??. That is, a higher degree of monopoly implies that the average price
rises relatively to the average unit prime cost.
The ratio of proceeds to prime costs in an industry can be linked with the relative
share of wages in value added as follows:
proceeds = ? (? +?) ? (2)
where?? and? denote aggregate wages and the aggregate cost of materials, respectively.
Subtracting the cost of materials from both sides of equation (2) leads to an expression
of value added:
value added ? proceeds?? = ? (? +?)?? ?
value added?? = (? ? 1) (? +?)?
value added = ? + (? ? 1) (? +?) ? (3)
In the light of equation (3), the relative share of wages in the value added of the
6
industry can be captured neatly as
? = ?
value added
=
?
? + (? ? 1) (? +?) ?
? = 1
1 + (? ? 1) (? + 1) ? (4)
where ? is the ratio of the aggregate cost of materials to the wage bill (ib., p.28). Clearly,
a higher degree of monopoly (?) leads to a lower wage share. In e?ect, Kalecki unveils the
connection between the evolution of the labour income share and the degree of monopoly
with an invaluable theoretical clarity.
It is worth noting that in the last thirty years or so we are experiencing an old power
struggle between competition and monopoly in new clothes with a well manifested out-
come: the systemic creation and preservation of inequality and business concentration via
Call-Put policy options, in the pure sense of "unwarranted" rights.5
2.2 Wage Gap, Frictional Growth and the Kalecki Insight
Challenging the widely accepted perspective that the wage-productivity gap vanishes in
the long run and thus the labour income share is neutral to labour demand, Karanassou
and Sala (2011) considered a stylised wage-setting equation depicting the adjustment of
wages to productivity movements:
?? = ?1???1 + (1? ?1) ???? (5)
where ?? denotes log real wage, ??? is labour productivity (in logs), and the autore-
gressive parameter is 0 ? ?1 ? 1. Higher order lags, other explanatory variables (i.e.
unemployment and wage-push factors, such as benefits and union power), and the er-
ror term are ignored for simplicity. Wage dynamics in equation (5) can be justified in
terms of wage/price staggering (Taylor, 1979, 1980), or wage aspirations (e.g. Ball and
Mo?tt, 2002), or the reconciliation between the empirical Phillips-curve and theoretical
wage-curve relations (Blanchard and Katz, 1999).
It should be further pointed out that the dynamic wage-setting (5) is in line with the
dominant view of a unitary elasticity of wages with respect to productivity in the long
5Hatgioannides and Karanassou (2011) unwind the Call-Put policy options, facilitated by the seventies
invention of FIAT money, and explain how they have engineered the dysfunctional market system of a
Warrant Economy. The latter is the most recent phase of the ever transforming power base of monopoly
capitalism to anihillate competition. Seen from this angle, financialisation is merely a symptom of Call-
Put provisions, a business situation that advances multi-source profits and "optimises" in the Warrant
Economics cocoon of market activity.

run. This becomes apparent when we rewrite it as
?? = ???|{z}
?trend? or steady-state
? ?1

?cycle ? if long-run growth=0
?frictional growth ? otherw ise
? (6)
where ? is the first di?erence operator. If growth is zero, then wages move in line with
productivity, but the higher the growth is the more they trail productivity. Taking first
di?erences, and assuming that the growth rate of productivity stabilises with the passage
of time, we obtain the conventional benchmark that the growth rate of real wages is equal
to productivity growth in the long run.
In contrast to the standard dictum, and whilst maintaining the assumption of a unitary
long-run elasticity of wages with respect to productivity, Karanassou and Sala (2011)
argue that productivity growth a?ects wages at all time horizons due to frictional growth.
The latter is a phenomenon generated by the interplay of lags and growth in the wage
setting process, the implication of which is that the growth of ?wage aspirations? does not
eventually catch up with productivity growth.
Consequently, equation (6) conveys the following key point: the real wage can be de-
composed into two terms, the ?trend? and frictional growth of the model. If productivity
does not grow in the long run, the real wage will stabilise in the long run. In this case
frictional growth is zero and the second term of equation (6) describes the ?cyclical? com-
ponent of real wages. Put di?erently, the steady-state and long-run versions of dynamic
wage setting coincide only in the utopian scenario of zero growth and/or no dynamics.
We highlight the fact that, since the long-run elasticity of the real wage with respect
to productivity is unity regardless of whether frictional growth is zero or not, the focus
of economists on elasticities implied that the phenomenon of frictional growth would be
ostracised from the analysis of macro-labour models. This took place despite the plau-
sibility of a dynamically growing environment that gives rise to the interplay of frictions
and growth.
The Kalecki Insight
Traces of the interplay between lags and growth can be detected in the theory of economic
dynamics of Kalecki ([1954]2009): ?It is known that prices of raw materials undergo larger
cyclical fluctuations than wage rates. The causes of this phenomenon can be explained as
follows. Even with constant wage rates the prices of raw materials (??) would fall in a
depression as a result of a slump in ?real? demand. Now, the cuts in money wages during
a depression can never ?catch up? with the price of raw materials because wage cuts in
turn cause a fall in demand and hence a new fall in the prices of primary products.? (ib.,
8
p.24)
We endeavour to express analytically Kalecki?s argument with a simple first-order
dynamic equation, ?? = ????1 + (1? ?) ???? and its reparameterisation:
?? = ???|{z}
?trend? or steady-state
? ?
1? ????| {z }
?cycle ? if long-run growth=0
?frictional growth ? otherw ise
? (7)
In view of equation (7), let us interpret Kalecki?s statement as [our additions in italics
and in ()]: wages do not adjust fully to movements in the prices of raw materials (???)
which would fall in a depression as a result of a slump in ?real? demand. Now, the cuts in
money wages during a depression can never ?catch up? (?? = ???) with the price of raw
materials because wage cuts in turn cause a fall in demand and hence a new fall in the
prices of primary products (interplay between dynamics and the shift in the determinant).
We should remark that, for a variety of issues at the core of the economic spectrum,
frictional growth has substantial implications, such as (i) the irrelevance of the natural
rate as a long-run attractor of unemployment, and (ii) the existence of an inflation-
unemployment tradeo? in both the short and long run.6
3 Personal Income Distribution
From the trauma of the stagflating 1970s and the ensuing deregulation starting in the
1980s, to the roaring 1990s and up to the great moderation of the 2000s, the pillars of
conventional wisdom in economic policy were established on the premises of low inflation,
reasonably good and sustainable growth, and relatively low unemployment. Issues of
inequality and distribution had been ostracised from the analysis of economic a?airs as
it was thought that they could be trivially resolved under the holy trinity of the above
economic outcomes.
In the midst of the worst since the 1930s economic crisis, the alarming rise in un-
employment and the significant numbers of foreclosures that sparked the protest against
the rich-poor divide, the distribution issue resurfaces in the political scene after its long
absence from the lexicon of mainstream economists.
3.1 Measuring Inequality
Figure 1 shows that inequality increased by 20% over the 1960-2009 period (from 0.36 in
1960 to 0.44 in 2009). Although our summary measure of the personal income distribution
6See, for example, Karanassou, Sala, and Salvador (2008), and Karanassou, Sala and Snower (2010).
9
is the Gini coe?cient, it is worth highlighting its di?erences from alternative measures
of top income shares. The Gini ratio (or relative income) is constructed by the Census
Bureau using internal Current Population Survey (CPS) data, while income trends in
terms of top shares are obtained by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax return data.7
CPS data measure pre-tax, post-transfer income, and exclude capital gains. In con-
trast, although the IRS data refer to pre-tax income, they exclude most transfer income
(since the latter is generally not taxable) but include capital gains, stock options and
bonuses. Survey data have been criticised for not being able to fully capture the top end
of the distribution due to topcoding, undercoverage, and underreporting of top incomes.
The availability of tax return data for longer time spans than survey data is a further
attractive feature of the former. On the other hand, the Gini statistic has a twofold
advantage: (i) it is a more comprehensive measure of inequality as it uses data on all
incomes rather than just the richest end of the spectrum, and (ii) it includes many socio-
demographic variables, since the CPS survey questions about income are broader than
those on IRS tax forms.8
The typical interpretation of the Gini index is through the geometry of a Lorenz
diagram plotting the cumulative population shares, from the poorest to the richest, against
their cumulative income shares. It is the area between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal
(45?) line as a ratio of the area below the diagonal (e.g. see Brewer et al., 2006, p.68). As
the value of the Gini statistic increases from zero to one, the more unequal the income
distribution becomes.
A more intuitive interpretation than the standard geometric one is given by Shorrocks
(2005), where the Gini coe?cient is portrayed as the division of a "pie" into two unequal
shares. For example, a Gini value of 0.40 is obtained from the division of an aggregate
economic pie worth $1 into 90c and 10c. Presenting inequality as ?a 2-way division of a
pie in which one person gets 9 times the other is a powerful way of capturing the extent
of income di?erences.? Since the "fair" share in a 2-way division is 0.50, the Gini value of
0.40 represents the excess share of the richest person (Gini= 0?90? 0?50).
7For a reconciliation of estimates from CPS and IRS tax data see the authoritative work by Burkhauser
et al. (2012).
8The Gini ratio is most easily calculated from unordered size income, ?? data as the ?relative mean
di?erence?, i.e., the mean of the di?erence between every possible pair of individuals divided by the mean
size ? (http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=gini+coe?cient):

3.2 Inequality Burst
Although we use the Gini index to measure inequality, and although the issue of how
closely top income shares track the Gini coe?cient is far from being resolved,9 it is worth-
while to point out some dramatic results on the top end of the personal distribution
spectrum that have dominated the debate in recent years.
The graphic evidence in Figure 2 shows that, since the late 1970s, income inequality
has evolved in terms of an upward ?trend? rather than ?episodes? of falling/increasing
inequality. In 2008 the top 1% appropriated 17.7% of the national income amounting to
an increase of 111% since 1960, most of it arising after the second half of the eighties.
Seen from the other side of the spectrum, the decreasing income shares of the bottom
99% reflect the continuing squeeze of the middle classes since the 1980s.
Piketty and Saez (2006) demonstrate that the last time the top percentile reached a
value of around 18% was before WWI. More astounding is the observation by Saez (2010)
that the top 0.01% in 2008 took in 5 percent of the national income, a level which until
the late nineties had not been witnessed since 1928 (ib., Figure 3). Wol? and Zacharias
(2006) further document that, over the 1982-2000 period, the share of the top percentile
increased from 9.9% to a staggering 17.4%, using the standard measure of money income,
and from 14.1% to 20.1% using the their measure of wealth adjusted income. In a brief
overview of trends in income inequality, Mankiw (2010) notes that since the mid-1970s
the share of total income of the top 0.01% (i.e. those with annual income of more than
$11 million) has increased about sixfold.
Studying ?Top Incomes in the Long Run of History?, Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez (2011)
use the Pareto law for top incomes to obtain the (cumulative) distribution function for
income ? and focus on what they refer to as the inverted Pareto coe?cient, ?? This is
the ratio of average income ??(?) of individuals with income above ? to ??The authors
argue that the coe?cient ? has more intuitive economic appeal, since a higher ? means a
fatter upper tail of the distribution. They find that ?in the United States, the ? coe?cient
(estimated at the top percentile threshold and excluding capital gains) increased gradually
from 1.69 in 1976 to 2.89 in 2007 as top percentile income share surged from 7.9% to
18.9%?. It is further noted that when capital gains are included, ?the rise of the ?
coe?cient is even more dramatic, from 1.82 in 1976 to 3.42 in 2007?.10
In the Financial Times (2008, October 29) we read that ?Between 2000 and 2006 the
US economy expanded by 18 per cent, whereas real income for the median working class
dropped by 1.1 per cent ... Meanwhile, the top tenth saw an improvement of 32 per cent
9The study of Burkhauser et al. (2012) is particularly informative about the di?erences in estimated
inequality trends that can arise from di?erences in the definition of income (and the way its distribution
is summarised) or from di?erences in the data sources. Nevertheless, the focus of our work does not loose
weight.

in their incomes, the top 1 per cent a rise of 203 per cent the top 0.1 per cent a staggering
gain of 425 per cent.? Wol? and Zacharias (2006, p. 5) note that in 2004, the median
net worth of the individuals in the Forbes 400 list was $1.5 billion ?as compared to the
median net worth of $93,000 for all other households.?
As the increase in the share of the top percentile has been accompanied by the ex-
ceptional growth in top executives? pay relative to the salaries of employees, the issue of
whether the so called "working rich"11 have replaced top capital owners (the "rentiers")
at the top of the economic ladder is open to debate. For example, Wol? and Zacharias
(2006) do not support this issue, whereas Piketty and Saez (2006) argue in its favour.
Interestingly, the Financial Times (2010, February 3) reported that ?A packed session
at the World Economic Forum in Davos...addressed the issue of executive compensation
and the huge rise in the pay gap between chief executives and ordinary workers in their
organisations. ...The best-paid person in a US company was paid about 40 times that of
the worst-paid person a generation ago. Now the multiple is about 300. ...Asked whether
the reason was that management had improved hugely; executives were underpaid in the
past; their jobs were more onerous today, or whether executives had collectively exploited
market power to raise their salaries, all of the members of the panel agreed that the last
possibility was closest to the truth.?
Apparently, the personal income distribution theme was forced to enter (for the first
time) in the agenda of the World Economic Forum in Davos 2012, where the priority(!)
of tackling growing inequality generated heated discussions (see the reports by BBC on
27/1, Bloomberg Businessweek 31/1, and others).

4 Modelling the Distributions
To evaluate the driving forces that jointly determine the labour share and inequality,
we postulate a system of equations for the functional and personal income distributions.
Figure 3 sketches the system?s key dimensions and illustrates the anatomy of the income
distribution network.
Figure 3. Anatomy of the distribution nexus.
Capital
accumulation
Labour shareGlobalisation Inequality
Financialisation
4.1 Labour Share Equation
We model the functional income distribution using a log-linear equation for the labour
share, ???:
??? = ?0 + ?1????1 ? ?2??? + ?3??? + "other"+ ?1?? (8)
where ??? is trade, ??? denotes capital intensity, the ??s are positive parameters with
?1 ? 1? and ?1? is a strict white noise error term. "Other" refers to business and household
taxes, the growth rate of working age population as a proxy for migration flows, and lags of
the explanatory variables. (Variables are defined in Table 1.) The autoregressive element
in specification (8), typical in dynamic time series equations, controls for the empirical
relevance of labour adjustment costs in the model.
Capital intensity (i.e. the capital-output ratio) was introduced as a major factor
in the labour share equation by Bentolila and Saint Paul (2003). A positive elasticity
between the two variables (?3 ? 0) indicates that labour and capital are complements
(ib., p.22). Although it is tempting to interpret capital intensity as a variable driven
by technology, Stockhammer (2009) is right to note that, from a Keynesian perspective,
capital accumulation ?will be driven to some extent by changes in animal spirits that are
not primarily related to technology.? (ib., p.31)
Capital intensity is also a driving force of the labour share equations in Milberg and
Winkler (2010b), and Cecci and Garc?a-Pe?alosa (2010), albeit the latter use capital per
worker to capture capital intensity. Capital intensity is also considered by Milberg and
Winkler (2010a) as a determinant in their profit share equation (in e?ect, the profit share
is one minus the labour share).
Another major factor in the wage gap evolution is trade (or the degree of openness),
which is commonly interpreted as a proxy for the central aspects of the globalisation
13
process (e.g. IMF, 2007). Contrary to the prediction of Heckscher-Ohlin theory, it is
widely accepted in the empirical literature that trade openness exerts a negative influence
on the labour share.
Financialisation is the third and final key factor in the unraveling of the distributional
nexus. Our point of view is that, while it a?ects directly the personal income distribution
(see below), it enters indirectly the functional income distribution via the capital intensity
factor. Following the reasoning in the literature on the negative e?ect of financialisation
on real investment (e.g. Orhangazi, 2008), it can be argued that capital accumulation
is the transmission channel of financialisation to the labour market (Gonz?lez and Sala,
2011).
4.2 Gini Coe?cient Equation
As in Karanassou and Sala (2012), we examine the inequality factors with a log-linear
model along the lines of the reduced form inequality equation in Checci and Garc?a-
Pe?alosa (2010). Our autoregressive distributed lag model for income inequality has the
following form:
????? = ?0 + ?1??????1 ? ?2??? + ?3??? + "other"+ ?2?? (9)
where ????? is the Gini coe?cient (in logs), ??? denotes financial payments (the sum of
dividends and interests as percent of corporate profits), and the ??s are positive para-
meters with ?1 ? 1? "Other" refers to direct and indirect taxes, and lags of the various
determinants, and ?2? is a strict white noise error term.
Blinder and Esaki (1978) introduced the approach of regressing the share of the ?th
quintile of the income distribution on the overall unemployment rate. Here, rather than a
"group" perspective on inequality of the ?th income share regressand, we have an aggregate
perspective on inequality through regression (9). The Gini statistic captures inequality
by measuring the allocation of income in (real) monetary terms to the various groups
of agents. Therefore, wages, benefits, rewards to capital or labour, and institutions that
facilitate such rewards are legitimate candidate determinants in a Gini regression. On one
hand, having unemployment as an additional driving force in the model carries the risk
of blurring the results.12 On the other, the e?ect of unemployment on inequality can be
satisfactorily addressed by examining the relationship between the various income classes
and the existence of unemployment ? la Blinder and Esaki (for example, see Mocan, 1999).
It is widely understood that higher corporate profits as a share of national income lead
12Consider, for example, the Gini equation of Checchi and Garc?a-Pe?alosa (2010). As the negative
and insignificant unemployment coe?cient using OLS and IV (Table 4, p. 428) becomes positive and
significant with 3SLS (Table 5, p. 431), it is hard to justify such a u-turn of the estimates on the grounds
of endogeneity and cross-equation correlation alone.
14
to (i) higher investment and (ii) the engagement of non-financial businesses in financial
markets (e.g. due to fees income), i.e. the ?financialisation? of the industry (Stockhammer,
2004; Milberg and Sch?ller, 2008; Milberg and Winkler, 2010a, among others). Recog-
nising the link between corporate profits and financialisation, the finding that financial
payments have a positive impact on the Gini coe?cient implies that financialisation has
a "direct" adverse e?ect on inequality. For an in-depth analysis of an intricate cobweb of
institutional policy options that distort competition and accelerate economic concentra-
tion, and the systemic exploitation of inequality via novel and toxic forms of securitisation
see Hatgioannides and Karanassou (2011).
5 Estimated Model
We need to point out that our investigation of the two-equation model (8)-(9) is in the
context of the chain reaction theory (CRT) framework that is led by the bidirectional
feedback between a prior viewpoint (or theory) and an observations-driven analysis.13
As such, our modelling approach is not subject to the so-called theoretical versus data-
driven debate. Put di?erently, our macroeconometric methodology aims at exploring the
symbiotic relationship of theory and evidence, rather than bridging the "gap" between
the two through some sort of reverse engineering.
Our econometric application follows the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) ap-
proach, also known as bounds testing. The ARDL procedure, developed by Pesaran
(1997), Pesaran and Shin (1999), and Pesaran, Shin and Smith (2001), has the advantage
of yielding consistent short- and long-run estimates irrespective of whether the regressors
are I(1) or I(0). Since an ARDL equation can be reparameterised in error-correction form
and its long-run solution can be interpreted as the cointegrating vector of its variables,
the ARDL procedure can be viewed as a rigorous alternative to the standard integra-
tion/cointegration techniques.
5.1 Data
We use annual observations over the 1960-2009 period obtained from the US Federal
Reserve (data on dividends, interests, and corporate profits), the European Commission
Ameco database (data on total net capital stock), and the OECD Economic Outlook (rest
of variables). Time series data on income inequality are supplied by the Census Bureau
13The ?chain reaction? epithet flags the crucial role of impulse response functions in CRT model building.
For a comprehensive discussion of the key features of chain reaction theory (CRT) models, simultaneous
equations (SE), and vector autoregressions (VARs), and their main disparities, see Karanassou and Sala
(2010, Section 3). The authors argue that the CRT provides an improvisation and synthesis of the SE and
VAR methodologies. For the contribution of the ?chain reaction? analysis to unemployment and Phillips
curve models see Karanassou, Sala and Snower (2010).

and correspond to ???? ratios for family household income.14 Our financialisation variable,
measured by (net) interests and dividends as a percent of pre-tax profits of non financial
corporations (??), accommodates su?ciently the two-sided role of financialisation. On
one hand, the financial receipts crowd out the incentive of corporate management for real
investment and, on the other, the financial payouts drain its funds (retained earnings) for
real investment (Gonz?lez and Sala, 2011).
Table 1 describes the variables used in the selected specifications of the labour share
and inequality equations.15
Table 1. Definitions of variables.

? real compensation per employee ?? (direct taxes on households)/GDP

Note: Variables are in logs unless otherwise indicated.
Sources: OECD Economic Outlook, European Commission,
US Federal Reserve, US Census Bureau.
As in Karanassou and Sala (2011, 2012), we follow the European Commission method-
ology in their Ameco database and compute the adjusted labour share as
?? = total compensation/dependent employment
GDP at factor costs/total employment
=
total compensation
GDP at factor costs
total employment
dependent employment
?
In this way, total labour compensation includes both dependent and self-employment
compensation, and GDP excludes taxes and subsidies, which are not a component of
generated income and need to be excluded from the calculation of the labour income
share. Once the labour share is computed, we retrieve the average wage per employee
(including self-employment) as ? = ????? , where ? is total employment and ? is the
standard measure of GDP at market prices. Note that ?, ?, ?, and ?? (defined in Table 1)
are the log counterparts of? , ? , ? and ??. It follows that the labour share, ?? = ????,
can also be interpreted as the wage-productivity gap.
14(www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/inequality). It is important to point out that
our choice of the Gini time series data we use is restricted by their availability. Income for family
households has a longer time span than the one for total households, which can be abtained only since
1967. Also note that both household series are available for money income rather than equivalised income.
15Although we have worked with an extended dataset (including competitiveness, union density, and
benefits) we only report the estimates of variables entering the selected specifications.
16
5.2 Results
Tables 2 and 3 present our estimates of the labour share and Gini equations, respec-
tively, from 1962 to 2009. Although our empirical approach is a general to specific one,
for expositional purposes, we first present the basic autoregressive equation E1 and then
sequentially add the control variables. This allows the equation to progressively increase
its explanatory power, reduce the standard errors of the regression, and minimise poten-
tial biases from omitted variables. Equations E6 and E7 in Table 2, and E5 and E6 in
Table 3, display the selected specifications of the model by estimated by ordinary least
squares (OLS) and three stage least squares (3SLS) to accommodate endogeneity and
cross-equation correlation. These specifications have been selected by the optimal lag-
length algorithm of the Schwartz information criterion, and pass the standard misspeci-
fication tests - for residual autocorrelation, normality, linearity, and heteroskedasticity -
and the cusum and cusum2 structural stability tests.
5.2.1 Labour Share Estimates
The first exogenous variable appearing in Table 2 (see equation E2) is trade, or the degree
of openness. It has the expected negative sign, which is robust across specifications.
Working-age population is not significant in levels and clearly enters as a (log) di?erence.
The growth of this variable implies that there is no long-run relationship between the
labour share and (the level of) working-age population.
In model E4 we add capital intensity, a crucial factor in the evolution of the wage-
productivity gap. As shown in Bentolila and Saint-Paul (2003), a positive coe?cient
of this variable, which is what we find, reflects the complementarity between labour and
capital. The authors argue (ib., p.24) that ?...as long as labor is paid its marginal product,
there should be a one-for-one relationship between the labor share and the capital-output
ratio...? We estimate a long-run capital intensity elasticity of 0.35
h
= 0?14
(1?0?60)
i
, which does
not di?er much from the 0.24 value obtained by Bentolila and Saint-Paul using a di?erent
sample, database, and estimation technique.
In equation E5 direct taxes on business have the expected negative sign on account of
their negative influence on employment (which is in the numerator of the labour income
share ratio). Finally, our preferred specification is equation E6. As expected, direct taxes
on households a?ect the wage-productivity gap positively, which signifies their role as a
wage-push factor (recall that wages are also in the numerator of the labour share).
17
Gini Estimates
Looking at the Gini regressions in Table 3, the highly significant autoregressive coe?cient
of the inequality model decreases in value, as expected, as we augment the set of explana-
tory variables. Nevertheless, persistence remains high at around 0.8. The implication of
high persistence is that the long-run e?ects of the determinants are much higher than the
short-run ones.
Our selected specification, equation E5 estimated by 3SLS, measures the e?ects of
the functional income distribution, financial profits, and fiscal progressivity on income
inequality.
The labour share (??) evolution has a negative impact on the personal income dis-
tribution across all time horizons. On the other hand, financial payments (??) exert an
upward pressure on inequality, contemporaneously and in the long run, while the negative
e?ect of their change (???) dissipates rather fast. Finally, the higher the progressivity of
the fiscal system (? ?), the lower is inequality.

6 Evaluating the Distributional Consequences
Having established the statistical significance and adequacy of our model, we unveil its
economic significance by evaluating the dynamic contributions of the shocks (or impulses)
to the time paths of the labour share and inequality. "Shocks" are given shape in the chain
reaction approach by the changes in the exogenous variables, rather than the residuals of
the estimated model.16 In this way, the impulse response functions (IRFs) of the system
16The point raised by Blanchard (2009, p. 220) on the issue is notable: ?The use of "shocks" is fraught
with philosophical, but also with practical, di?culties: Technological shocks, animal spirits, changes in
perceived uncertainty, etc. all have deeper causes, which themselves have even deeper causes, and so on.?
19
identify the impact of the actual changes in an exogenous factor on the evolution of the
endogenous variables over a specific sample interval.17
In what follows we measure the distributional consequences of capital intensity, trade,
and financial payments with counterfactual simulations. In particular, the estimated
system (equations E7 in Table 2 and E5 in Table 3) is simulated by fixing each of these
three main driving forces (one at a time) at their values at the start of the selected time
intervals. The span of the simulation periods depends on the turning points of their
time paths. In e?ect, simulating the responses of the endogenous variables answers the
question: How have the ups and downs of these exogenous variables contributed to the
evolution of the labour share and the Gini index?
Figure 4 plots the actual series (solid lines) together with the trajectories of their
values fixed at the start of each selected period (dotted lines). The intervals 1982-1989,
1989-1991, 1991-2000, and 2000-2009 in Figure 4a clearly capture the falls and rises in
capital intensity. In the case of the upward trend in trade (Figure 4b), and thus the
absence of any turning points, the analysis is conducted for each decade. In contrast,
financial payments exhibit a highly volatile upward trend until 1990, followed by spells
of major swings spanning the 1991-1997, 1997-2001, 2001-2005, and 2005-2009 periods
(Figure 4c).

Regarding our simulation results, note that (i) the first column in Figures 5 and 6
portrays the functional income distribution consequences of capital intensity and trade,
respectively, and (ii) the second column pictures their consequences for the personal in-
come distribution. In Figures 5-7 solid lines plot actual values, while dotted lines plot
simulated ones.
6.1 Capital Intensity Contributions
The positive relation between the labour share and capital accumulation becomes apparent
in Figures 5a-d. For example, consider the capital intensity contributions to the wage gap
during the eigthies (Figure 5a). This simulation answers the question: ?Had capital
intensity remained at its 1982 value, instead of falling, what would have been the labour
share level in 1989??
The distance between the solid and dotted lines measures the dynamic contributions
of capital intensity to the labour share time path. From 1982 to 1989, the decrease in the
capital/GDP ratio explains 75.7% of the 3.7 percentage points (pp) drop in the labour
share
?

69?2?65?5 =

?
. In a similar fashion, the decrease in capital intensity in the
1990s explains 81.0% of the 2.2 pp widening of the wage gap (Figure 5c). The picture
changes dramatically in the noughties (Figure 5d) as the increase in capital accumulation
prevented the labour share from falling by an additional 2.8 pp.
Recall that capital intensity a?ects inequality indirectly via its e?ect on the labour
share with the opposite sign, albeit of a lower magnitude. Figure 5e shows that its fall dur-
ing the eighties explains 57.1% of the 2.1 pp increase in the Gini index

.
In turn, the decrease in capital intensity during the nineties was responsible for about 25%
of the 3.6 pp deterioration of the personal income distribution (Figure 5c). On the other
hand, had capital accumulation remained at its low value in 2000 for the rest of the
decade, rather than increasing smoothly, the Gini would have increased by an extra 2.1
pp (Figure 5h), i.e. inequality would have been three times worse

6.2 Globalisation Contributions
As shown in equation E7 of Table 2, the globalisation process (defined by trade, ???) a?ects
the labour share negatively in the long run and positively in the short run. This is captured
by our simulations in Figures 6a-c. In the short- to medium-run years, the dotted lines
are below actual levels, indicating that a lower degree of openness would have resulted in
lower labour shares. But by the end of each decade, this positive e?ect either dissipates
(Figure 6a), or reverses its sign in line with the negative long-run relation (Figures 6b-c).
The latter figures show that the acceleration in the globalisation contributed to reduce
the labour share (i) by less than 20% of its 2.7 pp decrease in the nineties, and (ii) by 90%
21
of its 1.1 pp decrease in the noughties. According to this finding, the labour share would
have remained close to its year 2000 value had trade not increased in the noughties.
Interestingly, when looking at the globalisation consequences on the personal income
distribution, we observe that in the medium run the higher degree of openness (through
its labour share e?ect) lowered inequality. Unlike the labour share contributions of trade,
the inequality contributions of trade within each decade are dominated by the positive
short/medium-run e?ect of trade on the labour share. The negative long-run relation
between trade and the labour share takes longer to manifest in the inequality equation
because the labour share factor enters the Gini regression with a lag rather than contem-
poraneously.
Trade contributed to reduce the Gini index by 0.7 pp in the eighties, by 0.4 pp in
the nineties, and by 0.7 pp in the noughties (Figures 6d-f). This may be related to the
increasing share of cheap imports initially supplied by the emerging East-Asian countries
and then by China. It can be argued that the negative medium-run impact of openness
on inequality is one of the reasons that rising trade and the concomitant falling labour
shares have been tolerated.
6.3 Financialisation Contributions
Unlike capital accumulation and globalisation, financialisation does not influence the func-
tional distribution and has, instead, a direct impact on personal income. The estimated
positive relation between the financial payments factor (???) and inequality is given in
Table 3 and portrayed in Figure 7, where the first (second) column of the figure plots the
simulations for the periods when financialisation is rising (falling).
Figure 7a shows that financial payments account for 40.6% of the increase in the
Gini index over the 1980-1991 period; recall that the rest of this period?s inequality
increase (around 57.1%) is explained by the decrease in capital intensity. In turn, the
financialisation factor explains 83.3% of the increase in the Gini index during the 1997-
2001 interval (Figure 7b). Regarding the increase in the second half of the noughties, had
financial payments stayed as low as their 2005 value the Gini coe?cient would have fallen
back from 44 to around 43, its level at the start of the decade (Figure 7c).
In contrast, the slowdown in financial payments from 1991 to 1997 prevented the Gini
index to increase by an extra 0.9 pp, almost an additional 28% of the actual increase
(Figure 7d). Similarly, Figure 7e shows that the downfall of financial payments during
the 2001-2005 years prevented the Gini index to further increase by 0.9 pp, a magnitude
almost double its actual rise.

7 Conclusions
This paper explored the role of the wage-productivity gap in the income distribution
nexus. The determining factors of the labour share and inequality were jointly identified
with a two-equation model, where (i) the personal income distribution mainly depends on
the labour share and financialisation, and (ii) the functional income distribution is driven
by capital accumulation and globalisation, among other things. Emphasis was placed on
the argument that the transmission channel of financialisation to the functional income
distribution is through the capital intensity factor in the labour share equation.
Estimating the ARDL selected specifications of the system with 3SLS over the 1960-
2009 period in the US, we documented (i) the positive impact of financial payments
and the negative impact of the labour share on inequality; and (ii) the positive e?ect of
capital intensity and the negative e?ect of trade on the labour share. Measuring the chain
reactions of the (endogenous) labour share and Gini variables to the shocks in the system,
we evaluated the distributional consequences of capital accumulation, globalisation and
25
financialisation.
Our counterfactual simulations indicated that the most significant contributor to the
labour share trajectory in the eighties was the capital intensity factor, accounting for
around 76% of its fall. The picture changed dramatically by the noughties: it was the
acceleration in the trade factor that contributed to 90% of the 1.1 pp fall in the labour
share, while the rise in capital accumulation prevented it from falling by an extra 2.8 pp.
Regarding inequality, both capital accumulation and globalisation a?ect the Gini equa-
tion indirectly, via the labour share equation, with the reverse sign. The capital intensity
decrease explains about 57% of the increase in the Gini index in the eighties, and 25%
in the nineties. On the other hand, inequality would have been three times worse had
capital accumulation not increased after 2000. In terms of globalisation, the higher degree
of openness contributed to ease inequality, albeit by less than 1.0 pp in each decade.
Finally, although financialisation does not influence the functional income distribu-
tion, it has a direct impact on personal income and plays a key role in the inequality
developments. Our findings indicate that financial payments accounted for about 40%
of the increase in the Gini index during the eighties, and 83% of its increase over the
1997-2001 interval. Notably, had financialisation not increased in the second half of the
noughties, inequality would have fallen back to its level at the start of the decade.
In the precarious post-2008 era of high or rising unemployment rates and quite tense
socioeconomic phenomena, looking at income distribution issues through the lens of the
wage-productivity gap could enlighten economic policy. In a previous stage of our en-
quiry we put forward the concept of the inequality-employment ratio of labour share
elasticities as a barometer of economic pressure, signposting the degree of worsening in-
equality vis-a-vis job creation. Having now identified capital accumulation, globalisation,
and financialisation as driving forces of the income distribution network, we endeavour to
examine their impact on the labour share barometer in future work.
