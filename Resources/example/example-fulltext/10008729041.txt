Abstract
Are the observed spatial distributions of firms decided mostly by market-mediated,
economy-wide locational forces, or rather by non-pecuniary, sector-specific ones? This work
finds that the latter kind of forces weight systematically more than the former in deciding
firm location. The analysis uses Italian data on a variety of manufacturing and service
sectors spatially disaggregated at the level of Local Labor Systems.

1 Introduction
The factors leading to the formation of economic agglomerates have been identified since Mar-
shall (1890) with the pecuniary advantages that clustering provides thanks to deeper interme-
diary markets and larger pools of labor suppliers. The positive externalities stemming from
the increased availability of cheaper production factors are plausibly reinforced by the demand-
side effect that the simple presence of more consumers is likely to create. Together, cost-saving
and revenue-enhancing pecuniary factors generate a competitive advantage for local firms via
market-mediated interactions. Along these lines, in the context of the relatively recent ?New
Economic Geography? models, this agglomerative pull has been typically identified with the
feedback mechanism between local demand and local labor supply (Krugman, 1991). As such,
pecuniary elements tend to yield a common and general clustering of firms and households, which
engenders and reinforces urban agglomeration.
At the same time, however, several sectors of the economy show a gathering of common
activities in places that are not densely populated nor particularly well connected to metropoli-
tan areas. These specialized clusters escape the explanation provided by the pecuniary effects
of demand and supply: in fact, the sectoral production within a cluster exceeds local demand
by far. More plausibly, in these cases agglomeration results from non-pecuniary factors, which
generate a locational advantage for firms through productive relations that escape market ex-
change. Typically, these advantages are identified with the existence of positive externalities
produced by the flow of sector-specific technological knowledge, often scarcely codified, within
1
organizational contexts that allow and facilitate it (Becattini, 1990; Marshall, 1890). As such,
non-pecuniary factors are likely to engender the agglomeration of firms sharing very similar pro-
cesses and structures and operating within the same industry, thus leading to the formation of
clusters.
This work investigates the strength of the urbanization effect relative to sector-specific ag-
glomerative forces in shaping the observed geographical distribution of manufacturing and service
activities in Italy. The urbanization effect, plausibly being the outcome of pecuniary, market-
mediated interactions, is expected to act across the different economic sectors, albeit with pos-
sibly different strengths. Conversely, sector-specific agglomerative force stemming from techno-
logical and organizational specificities are expected to act within each sector separately. On the
ground of these considerations, we compare the observed spatial distributions of firms in each
sector with the ones predicted by the discrete choice model of Bottazzi and Secchi (2007), thus
allowing to assess the relative strength of various locational drivers, common or sector-specific,
on the attractiveness of a location. As such, while being similar in scope to other approaches
in the literature (Desmet and Fafchamps, 2006; Devereux et al., 2004; Dumais et al., 2002; El-
lison and Glaeser, 1997, 1999; Kim, 1995; Maurel and Se?dillot, 1999; Overman and Duranton,
2001), this work differs from them by producing not only estimates of the relevant locational
parameters but also a prediction of the entire spatial distribution of firms in each sector. This
feature constitutes a commonality with other works by Bottazzi et al. (2007, 2008); however,
the present one improves upon them by using maximum likelihood methods to obtain point es-
timates of the parameter of interest and Monte Carlo re-sampling to estimate the variance and
thus the statistical significance of the different marginal effects. As such the magnitudes of the
various locational drivers will be unambiguously interpretable and directly comparable one with
the other.
The main result presented here regards the effect played by market-mediated pecuniary mo-
tives and technology-related non-pecuniary motives in deciding firm location. The present analy-
sis finds that firm location is affected by both. However, the weight of the former is systematically
lower that the weight of the latter. These findings may be taken to imply that any attempt to
explain the spatial structure of economic activities cannot prescind from considering the tech-
nological and organizational dynamics internal to each sector, since these are the major factors
deciding the geography of corporate location.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the ISTAT database on
which the analysis is carried out together with the choices that were operated on the data.
Section 3 introduces some descriptive statistics as well as some hints regarding the distinct
effects of urbanization and industrial clustering on spatial distributions. Section 4 sketch the
discrete choice model on which theoretical predictions are based. Section 5 proceeds to estimate
the marginal effects of the various factors identified as possible explanators of the attractiveness
of locations. Section 6 summarizes and discusses the relevant results.
2 Data
The present analysis is based on Italian data taken from the Atlante statistico dei comuni ital-
iani (hereafter Atlas) published by ISTAT ISTAT (2006). From this database we take (i) the
census of manufactures and services, and (ii) the census of population and housing for the year
2001. The former census provides the data concerning the number of business units and work-
ers in each sector, while the latter census includes the data on the population living in each
geographical region. We consider only the business units classified as firms, neglecting instead
non-profit and governmental organizations. Under these conditions, the data for 2001 accounts
2
approximately for 3.5 million of business units and 13.8 million workers, which amount to 71.2%
of the employment in the Italian economy.
Sectors are disaggregated following the 2-digit ATECO classification (which corresponds to
the NACE classification). Sector ?36-Furniture and other manufacturing activities? is further
disaggregated at a 3-digit level in order to capture more accurately what the ?other? activities
were, namely: ?361-Furniture?,?362-Jewelry?, and ?363-Musical instruments?, plus the residual
?36R-Residual of sector 36?. With this disaggregation we can characterize more sharply some
industrial districts, which constitute an object of special interest for the present analysis and fall
precisely within the ?other? activities of sector 36. Instead, this kind of disaggregation was not
applied to the other residual sector concerning services, that is ?74-Other business activities?:
in fact, despite being residual, such sector is actually well characterized in productive terms as
it collects essentially professionals. Table 1 reports some summary statistics of the sectors under
analysis.1
Business units are distributed across 686 geographical locations identified as Local Labor
Systems (hereafter LLS).2 These are preferred over purely administrative regions because they
preserve the spatial continuity of phenomena, such as agglomeration, that are central to the
present analysis. In fact, by discretizing space according to administrative borders, some bias
can be created possibly due to an excessively coarse grained grid or to an excessively fine one,
as illustrated in Figure 1.
The shaded areas on the map represent two separate agglomerations: the smaller one is
contained in the micro-administrative region 7 and belongs to the macro-administrative re-
gion A; while the bigger agglomeration is located across the micro-administrative regions 1?6
and belongs to the macro-administrative regions A?D. Suppose that an agglomeration is de-
fined by the statistical criterion ?shaded area?. How many agglomerations would be counted if
micro-administrative regions were used as geographical unit of analysis? There would be seven
agglomerations, which clearly constitutes an overestimation. Apparently, spatial aggregation
would seem to help. If macro-administrative regions were used, the number of agglomerations
would reduce to four thus improving the measurement. However, if one further aggregation is
made hoping to solve completely the overestimation bias, the exact opposite problem arises:
joining macro-administrative regions A?D would lead to identify only one agglomeration. More-
over, this solution would decrease substantially the geographical significance of the chosen unit
of analysis; in fact, the unit A?D would be regarded as hosting an agglomeration although most
of its internal space is not actually characterized by such phenomenon (i.e. the blank blocks are
more than the shaded ones). In order to overcome these problems ISTAT proposes a methodol-
ogy that aggregates the smallest adjoining administrative units (i.e. municipalities) into bigger
geographical areas through an algorithm based on the flows of commuters. The aggregations
stemming from such algorithm are the LLSs ISTAT (1997); Sforzi (2000). Basically, an LLS
is a set of adjoining municipalities that have in common a relevant flow of commuters toward
the same municipality; as such they share their ?peripheral? role with respect to an economic
?center? with which they form a sole socio-economic region. Such criterion of aggregation allows
to go ?beyond? administrative borders: as shown in Figure 1, the borders of the LLS manage to
aggregate lower administrative units (i.e. the small squares) while crossing the borders of higher
order ones (i.e. regions A?D).

3 Empirical analysis
The present analysis spans economic sectors which are strongly heterogeneous in several dimen-
sions, as summarized in Table 1. First, the total number of business units N and workers W
change dramatically across sectors, thus implying that structurally different economic activities
are being taken into account. Second, sectors differ greatly in their spatial distributions in two
main respects. On one hand, the fraction F of locations hosting at least one firm in the sector
reveals that some sectors are spread literally everywhere (i.e. F ? 1) while others are present
only in some locations (i.e. F << 1). On the other hand, the maximum share of business units
found in a location, Max(nl/N), reveals that the scale of locational effects is greater in some
sectors than in others. As mentioned in the introduction, this heterogeneity in spatial distri-
bution is likely related to the varying weights that urbanization and positive externalities of
localization hold in each sector. Both factors contribute to increase the overall degree of spatial
concentration. A measure of the latter can be obtained looking at the skewness of the distribu-
tion of business units across locations. Skewed distributions signal that many locations host null
or small shares of the business units in the sector, while a few other locations capture most it;
conversely, less skewed distributions are associated to a more even spread of activities in space.
The Gini coefficient G corrected by sample size shows substantial differences in the degree of
spatial concentration that characterizes each sector (values of G close to 1 suggest a strong clus-
tering of activities). A second measure of the sectoral tendency to cluster is represented simply
by the number D of industrial districts associated to each sector. Generally, industrial districts
are located in non metropolitan areas and they are typically linked to peculiar organizational
and technological elements (Becattini, 1990). So we can take their number as a proxy for the
sectoral strength of positive localization externalities.
Interestingly, running a rank correlation corrected by ties between G and D reveals that the
two measures are not positively correlated. The Spearman index is ? = 0.204 and its p-value
is 0.189: hence, ? is not different from zero at 95% significance. Notice that in principle the

relationship between G and D can be weakened by the fact that more districts means more
occupied locations, thus inducing a greater spread of firms over space and, consequently, a
reduction of the Gini index. This effect could generate a measurement bias when running a
correlation between G and D. However, results do not change if a binary variable detecting
the presence/absence of industrial districts is considered instead of D. Call D? a variable such
that D? = 1 if the sector contains at least one industrial district and D? = 0 otherwise. Then,
the rank correlation corrected by ties between G and D? yields a Spearman index ? = 0.216
with a p-value of 0.163, which makes it not different from zero at 95% significance. The simple
message standing behind this statistics is that spatial concentration and industrial clustering are
two separate and unrelated phenomena, thus possibly driven by different underlying forces. In
particular, their discrepancy has to do with cities. To see this run the same correlation but using
the Gini index G? computed across all locations except metropolitan areas. Now the Spearman
rank correlation corrected by ties between G? and D yields a value of 0.3, having a p-value of
0.051. The correlation becomes statistically significant. The same is true for the rank correlation
between G? and D?, which yields a value of 0.3, having a p-value of 0.051.
To repeat, although these simple findings do not bear any strong implication per se, they
suggest the need to distinguish those agglomeration dynamics related to urbanization from the
ones linked to industrial clustering. Both phenomena generate spatial concentration, but their
underlying drivers are different.
4 A model of firm location
The present analysis is based on the discrete choice model described in Bottazzi and Secchi
(2007). The model assumes a fixed number of firms in the sector and derives their equilibrium
distribution in space assuming a sequence of separated profit-maximizing locational choices. The
assumption of a fixed number of firms is consistent with the observation that their net growth rate
in any sector is in general one order of magnitude smaller than their gross entry/exit rate. So the
sectoral dynamics in space is mainly a ?reallocation? of activities. Given these considerations,
the basic mechanism of the model is very simple.
Consider a single sector j composed by N firms. At each time step, one of them is randomly
chosen to die and make room for a new entrant, which will have to choose one location among
the L that compose space. Each location is characterized by an individual attractiveness, which
is proportional to the expected profitability that the firm will face by locating there. The
attractiveness of the location is composed of two terms: the first, al, is constant and captures
the ?fixed? advantages offered by the location (higher demand, lower marginal costs, better
infrastructures, etc.); the second, b, is proportional to the number of firms of the sector already
located there. Due to the heterogeneous preferences of firms (see Bottazzi and Secchi (2007) for
more details), the entrant?s probability of locating in location l is
pl ? al + b nl , b > 0 (1)
where nl is the number of firms belonging to the sector already located in l. Notice that b
does not depend on the location l and is constant: this is intended to capture the presence of
agglomerative forces acting on the firms of the same sector.
Bottazzi and Secchi (2007) find that the equilibrium distribution of firms across locations
n = (n1, . . . , nL) implied by the previous model is generally characterized by the Polya form
pi(n;a, b) =
N !?(A/b)
?(A/b+N)
L?
l=1
1
nl!
?(al/b+ nl)
?(al/b)
(2)
6
where a = (al, . . . , aL) are the geographic attractiveness of the L locations and A =
?
l al.
In the specific case of null agglomeration economies (that is b = 0), the equilibrium distribu-
tion of firms across locations n = (n1, . . . , nL) has the multinomial form
pi(n;a, b = 0) = N !
L?
l=1
1
nl!
(al
A
)nl
. (3)
Equations (2) and (3) represent short-run equilibrium distributions that depend on the sector-
specific geographic attractiveness of the different locations al. If the model were correct, the
median of firms observed in each location l would fluctuate around al/A, while the amplitude of
the fluctuations would decrease with the strength of the externality parameter b.
5 Maximum likelihood estimation and marginal effects
Assume that each location is characterized by a set of H variables xl = (x
1
l , . . . , x
H
l ). The idea
is to use these variables to model the geographic attractiveness of the different locations.
In the simpler case of null agglomeration economies, the equilibrium distribution (3) depends
on al but not on b. Hence, al can be written directly as a generic function of the H regressors,
al = c(?,xl), depending on a set of parameters ? to be estimated. With simple substitution, the
log-likelihood of the observed distribution of firms across locations as a function of the parameters
reads
log pi = logN !?
L?
l=1
log(nl!) +
L?
l=1
nl (log cl ? logC) , (4)
where C =
?L
l=1 c(?,xl). One can maximize the previous expression and obtain ML point
estimates for the parameters ??. In turn, these estimates define a geographic attractiveness
coefficient c?l = c(??,xl) for each location.
In the case of positive agglomeration economies, the equilibrium distribution (2) is a function
of both al and b. However, they appear only as the fraction al/b. Therefore, a generic functional
specification of the model can be obtained by setting al
b
= cl = c(?,xl). Then, the log-likelihood
of the observed distribution of firms reads
log pi = logN !?
?
l
log nl! +
L?
l=1

k=0
log(c(?,xl) + k)?
N?1?
k=0
log(C + k) . (5)
Again, one can maximize the previous expression and obtain ML point estimates for the param-
eters ?? and the coefficients c?l.
Assessing the effect of the H regressors and of the agglomerative pull b through the estimation
of the parameters ?? in the expression for c can be problematic. This is particularly true in
the Polya case, where the dependence of the likelihood on the ratio al
b
automatically induces
parametric redundancy in the model. In the present analysis we will characterize the impact of
the different covariates using the notion of marginal effect, as often done in discrete models.3 We
proceed as follows.
To begin with, notice that once the estimates ?? are obtained, one has an estimate of a?l (in the
multinomial case) or of the fraction c?l (in the Polya case). According to the original definition

of the model, the probability of choosing a location l is
pl =
a?l
A?
(6)
in the multinomial case and
pl =
bnl + al
bN +A
=
nl + cl
N + C
(7)
in the Polya case.
Then, the marginal effect of a given variable can be obtained by considering the elasticity of
the probability pl to its variation:
L?
l=1
?pl
? log xhl
=
L?
l=1
xhl
?pl
?xhl
. (8)
Notice that this represents a weighted average, across locations, of the marginal effect that the
variable exerts in the ?total pull? of each location. Locations with higher level of the variable
weight more than locations with lower levels.4 Equation (8) simplifies to
L?
l=1
?pl
? log xhl
=
L?
l=1

(1? pl) (9)
for the multinomial model and
L?
l=1
?pl
? log xhl
=
L?
l=1
xhl ?hcl
N + C
(1? pl) (10)
for the Polya model. In this latter case, the agglomerative strength exerted by the externality
coefficient b can be measured with the elasticity of pl to the location of an additional firm:
L?
l=1
?pl
? log nl
=
L?
l=1
nl
N + C
(1? pl) , (11)
Notably, the presence of the factor (1? pl) in (9), (10) and (11) indicates that the marginal
effects decrease when pl ? 1. Since pl is bounded in [0, 1], when the probability is closer to the
upper bound there is less room for a further increase. An unbounded measure, which captures
the total attractiveness of the location l, can be obtained by considering ql = ? log(1? pl). The
attractiveness ql is unbound from above and is increasing in the probability pl. In this case, the
marginal effects are
?q
? log xh
=
L?
l=1
xhl ?hal
A
. (12)
for the multinomial model and
?q
? log xh
=

N + C
. (13)
4Alternatively, one can consider the average marginal effect

l=1
?pl

(see next Section) we prefer the former specification.
8
for the Polya model. For the latter case, the elasticity of ql to the location of an additional firm
is
?q
? log n
=
N
N + C
. (14)
Notice that this expression does not depend explicitly on the functional form of c: the strength
of sector-specific positive externalities is measured via a combination of the number N of firms
in the sector and the sum of the estimated local attractiveness C. Being C = A
b
, greater values
of C are associated with a predominance of the total attractiveness of locations (i.e. A) over the
effect of sector-specific positive externalities (i.e. b); in turn, the marginal effect of an additional
firm decreases as C grows. In other terms, the larger the parameter C, and consequently the
smaller the marginal effect of additional firms, the lesser the locational choice of a firm is actually
affected by the choices of others.
A final warning is mandatory. In general the specification should be such that c(?, xl) is
positive for any l. Notice that when c ? 0+ the log-likelihood becomes minus infinity, so
that the maximization itself should automatically avoid this point. Since we rely on numerical
methods, however, the fulfillment of this condition is not automatically assured. Indeed, when
the actual maximum is near the boundary of the positivity domain, the adopted algorithm could
probe the function outside this domain, thus generating infinities. In what follows we will pay
particular attention to avoid this occurrence.
6 Model specification and results
The multinomial and Polya models introduced in the previous Section require the specification of
a functional form which relates the values of the variables xl in one location to its attractiveness.
In what follows we will use the following log-linear specification
c(?, xl) = exp
(?
h
?h log(xh,l) + ?0
)
. (15)
In the multinomial case, we set ?0 = 0. This is because in this case the log-likelihood (4)
is invariant for a rescaling factor, i.e. the transformation cl ? ?cl applied to each cl leaves
the likelihood level invariant. Consequently, leaving the ?0 to be estimated would result in an
over-specified model.
The specification in (15) is equivalent to the Cobb-Douglas functional form used in consumer
and producer theory. Indeed from the previous expression one has
c(?, xl) =
?
h
x?hh,l exp(?0) .
This expression describes the attractiveness cl as the accumulated multiplicative effect of the
different variables. Assume that the different variables represent different economic aspects of
the firm activity that the firm evaluates in order to chose were to locate. If, on average, the
probability to choose location l according to factor h is proportional to x?hh,l, and if the effects of
the different factors can be assumed as roughly independent, the combined probability of the firm
to choose this location is given by the expression in (15). Moreover, the log-linear specification
of c allows for a straightforward computation of the marginal effects defined in (12) and (13).
Indeed one has

for the multinomial model and

for the Polya model.
Starting from the functional specification in (15) we consider a model with three regressors.
First, we capture the pull of more populated area, i.e. the urbanization effect, by taking the
total population of the location (POP ). In this respect, our definition of urbanization forces
captures all the effect related to the sheer number of inhabitants, like the increased demand for
final goods and the availability of a larger labor market.
Then we aggregate, in each location, the firms belonging to the sectors appearing in Table 1
in two groups, manufacturing firms (MANUF ) and service firms (SERV ): MANUF includes
the sectors ranging from ?15-Food products? to ?36R-Residual of sector 36?, while SERV in-
cludes those from ?40-Electricity and gas? to ?74-Other business activities?. Notice that the
latter contains services to both local population and local firms. These variables are used to
construct two further regressors. First, the relative abundance of services, computed as the ratio
SERV/POP , is taken as a generic proxy of local economic development. In this respect the
inclusion of the construction sector and of the utilities (distribution of electricity, gas and water)
in the definition of services accounts for the availability of infrastructural resources. Second,
a measure of local specialization is obtained by considering the ratio MANUF/SERV . This
regressor can account for the existence of vertical relations in the production chain or of cross-
sectoral externalities among firms belonging to similar sectors. With this choice we end up with
three variables having very low correlation across sectors: Spearman?s correlation coefficients are
always lower than 10% and never significant. The orthogonality of the regressors will increase
the estimation efficiency and is compatible with the choice of the log-linear form (15). With
these considerations we end up following the specification
log c(?, xl) = ?0 + ?1 log POP + ?2 log
SERV
POP
+ ?3 log
MANUF
SERV
, (16)
where the constant term ?0 is set to 0 in the multinomial case while being regularly estimated in
the Polya case. Estimation is performed taking the z-score of the three regressors. In this way
the constant term exp(?0) represents the average effect. i.e. the value of the function c associated
to a location with an average value of the regressors. The z-scores are obtained by removing the
mean and dividing by the standard deviation each covariate. This procedure allows to compare
directly the coefficients associated with the different regressors and their marginal elasticities.
We also estimated an augmented six regressors model including, in addition to the variables
in (16), the surface of the location, a dummy variable taking value one for locations character-
ized by the presence of industrial districts (irrespectively of their sector) and a dummy variable
taking value one for larger metropolitan area. The inclusion of the location?s surface variable is
intended to capture the possible existence of congestion effects. The ?districts? dummy captures
the knowledge spillover effect generated by a particularly high concentrations of certain economic
activities. The ?urban? dummy captures plausible effects exerted by larger metropolitan area
on the local demand. With the only exception of the urban dummy for sector ?61-Water trans-
portation?, none of these variables resulted significant in none of the sectors under analysis for
both the multinomial and the Polya specification. Hence they were dropped from the analysis
and we will discuss the reduced model.
The model (16) was estimated on each sector separately.5 However, we wanted to avoid
5The values of the regressor is slightlty different when different sectors are considered because the variable
MANUF and SERV do not contain the firms of the sector under consideration.

sectors characterized either by a strong presence of publicly owned enterprises or by a decisive
dependence from public infrastructures. For this reason ?40-Electricity and gas?, ?41-Water?,
?61-Water transport? and ?62-Air transport? were dropped from the analysis. Moreover, we
ignored the residual sector ?36R-Residual of sector 36?, since it actually includes fairly inho-
mogeneous activities. Table 2 and Table 3 report the estimated marginal elasticities of the
three regressors considered for the multinomial and Polya specification respectively; for the lat-
ter case, Table 3 reports also the marginal elasticity of additional firms on the probability for
the location to attract settlements within the sector. Standard errors are obtained via Monte
Carlo re-sampling of the original distribution and reported as a percentage of the point estimate.
Values larger than 20% identify non-significant regressors. In any case, variables having values
larger than 15% should be regarded as only mildly significant. Finally, the last columns report
the model maximum log-likelihood (per observation). Since the number of observation is large
(686) and the differences in the number of parameters minimal (1), these numbers can be taken
as a relative measure of the goodness of fit of the two models.
Let us start by inspecting the results for the multinomial model reported in Table 2. Re-
member that this model does not contain any account for the existence of sector-specific positive
externalities. Nonetheless, a number of conclusions can be drawn.
First, the urbanization effect is very strong. The marginal elasticities with respect to POP are
always positive and significant. Addition of a small portions of population increase, on average,
the attractiveness of locations. This being the rule across almost all sectors, it is possible to
infer that higher degrees of urbanization end up attracting ?more of everything? with respect to
economic activities, although the size of such effect appears heterogeneous across sectors: it is,
for instance, three times larger for sector ?22-Publishing and printing? and sector ?72-Computer
and related activities? than for sector ?20-Wood processing?.
Second, our proxy for local development plays only a mild role. In a minority of the sectors
under investigation, additional small portions of services per head have a limited positive effect
on the attractiveness of a location. They are however totally irrelevant for the majority of them.
In fact the marginal elasticities connected to SERV/POP is significantly different from zero
only in few sectors (like ?17-Textiles? or ?70-Real estate activities?), and even in those cases
they turn out being about ten times smaller than the marginal elasticities connected to POP .
Third, specialization does not matter. The marginal elasticities connected toMANUF/SERV
is never significantly different from zero. Yet, it must be stressed that this finding does not deny
per se the role of vertical or horizontal linkages among firms: rather, it detects the economic
irrelevance of such linkages at this level of sectoral disaggregation. Such conclusion may well be
reverted if a finer sectoral disaggregation were used.
Moving to the Polya model, whose results are reported in Table 3, the first thing to notice
is that the qualitative effect of the different regressor remains the same. So what was said for
the multinomial model is still true when one accounts for sector-specific positive externalities.
This extension is however not trivial nor neutral. In fact, sector-specific positive externalities
appear as the rule in the economy. Comparing the negative log-likelihoods for the Polya model
in Table 3 with those for the multinomial model in Table 2 reveals that the former model fits
systematically better than the latter. Moreover, the marginal elasticity with respect to n is
always positive and significantly different from zero. This suggests not only the relevance of
sector-specific positive externalities, but also the irrelevance of congestion effects. This latter
aspect is particularly striking given the fine level of spatial disaggregation granted by the use
of LLSs. Therefore, those technological and organizational factors that are the likely cause of
sector-specific positive externalities should not be regarded as a ?special case? neither for what
concerns the various economic activities nor for what concerns their location. To the contrary,
positive externalities of location pervade the whole economy and seem to start as soon as the

borders of a market exceed those of a town, which is precisely the spatial dimension captured by
LLS.
A more direct comparison between the urbanization effect and the sector-specific externalities
can be obtained by comparing the marginal elasticities relative to n with those relative to POP
in Table 3. The latter outperform the former in most sectors (precisely 31 out of 38). For
the most disaggregated sectors, ?362-Jewelry? and ?363-Musical instruments?, the urbanization
effect turns out to be irrelevant (marginal effect non significantly different from zero) and the self-
reinforcing effects generated by the co-location of firms belonging to the same sector remains as
the unique explanatory variable. As expected, the relevance of the sectoral effect gets enhanced
when a finer disaggregation is considered. However, notice that this cannot be a general pattern,
otherwise the specialization regressor MANUF/SERV would result significant.
The improved fit of the Polya model has two implications: on one hand, it confirms that
positive externalities play a crucial role not only in some special sectors but rather across the
entire economy; on the other hand, it implies that a general account of the spatial structure of
economic activities cannot prescind from sector-specific technological and organizational consid-
erations. In other words, non-pecuniary positive externalities may perhaps not leave a ?paper
trail? but they certainly leave a strong footprint on the spatial distribution of firms, possibly
more than market-mediated forces do.
Finally, although the Polya model outperforms systematically the multinomial one, its abso-
lute goodness of fit remains to be assessed. A possible method consists in comparing, for each
sector, the predicted spatial distribution stemming from the Polya model with the one observed
in the data. To accomplish such comparison we construct histograms that synthesize the relevant
information into proper occupancy classes.
Occupancies f(n) count the number of locations hosting exactly n firms. For example, f(0)
is the number of locations containing 0 firms belonging to the sector under scrutiny; f(1) is the
number of locations hosting exactly 1 firm, and so on. Then, the general definition of occupancy
is
f(n) =
L?
l=1
?nl,n (17)
where ?nl,n is the Kronecker delta. It follows that
+??
n=0
f(n) = L ?j (18)
where, although infinity appears as upper bound, the summation stops effectively with the num-
ber of firms in the most populated location. To further synthesize information, observations in
each sector are grouped into classes whose ranges are defined by the geometric progression
Ck = [2
k ? 1, 2k+1 ? 2) k = 0, 1, 2, ? ? ? (19)

To summarize, Table 4 reports the range values for some of the occupancy classes.
From occupancy classes it is immediately possible to grasp whether the sector under scrutiny
is spatially concentrated or dispersed (see Figure 2). An high occupancy of the first classes
compared to the latter indicates that most locations host null or minimal portions of the sector,
while a few others have big shares. Therefore, the sector is spatially concentrated. To the
contrary, a more bell-shaped histogram indicates that locations tend to host similar ?typical?
portions of the sector, which is then more uniformly distributed in space.
As exemplified in Figure 2, the absolute goodness of fit of the Polya model varies across
sectors. In some cases, the predicted spatial distributions match very closely the observed ones,
while in other cases the discrepancy is greater. This heterogeneity in the goodness of fit might
depend on a series of factors. First, the specifications adopted in (15) and (16) may work well in
some sectors and less so in others; consequently, alternative specifications could possibly improve
the performance of the Polya model. Second, the variables used to estimate the coefficients in
(16) may not be the best explanators of the ratio al/b, which weights the ?fixed? attractiveness
of a location relative to the sector-specific externalities of the sector. Third, the level of sectoral
disaggregation that is necessary to characterize properly a sector in geographic terms may vary
across sectors, in particular when services are analyzed next to manufacturing (see Section 3).
Naturally, this set of considerations about the goodness of fit of the Polya model create room for
future empirical efforts addressed at the further amelioration of predictive performances.
7 Conclusion
The present work has proposed an empirical framework to explain what makes a location at-
tractive to firms of a particular sector. A series of conclusions have been drawn. First, between
15
two alternative but comparable models, the one not allowing for sector-specific positive exter-
nalities matched the data systematically worse than the model allowing for them. Second, both
urbanization effects and sector-specific positive externalities were found to affect significantly the
location of firms. However, and third, externalities were often found to be more relevant than
urbanization motives. According to these considerations, an explanation of the spatial structure
of economic activities must rely primarily on the the technological dynamics that are the likely
cause of sector-specific positive externalities, and only secondarily on urbanization effects.
The analysis presented here is open to a number of further developments. To begin with, our
conclusion about the relevance of sector-specific positive externalities is sharply in contrast with
the one of Kim (1995) concerning manufacturing in the US; therefore, it would be interesting to
apply our framework on US data, as well as on other countries, to detect how the results would
possibly change. Further developments should regard also the use of alternative specifications,
in order to verify how they affect the discrepancy between the predicted spatial distributions
and the observed ones. Similarly, it would also be useful to try out other explanatory variables
either to substitute or to be added to the ones used here. Finally, it is necessary to evaluate sys-
tematically how both spatial and sectoral disaggregations influence the outcome of the analysis:
this operation would help not only to test the ?robustness? of the model but also to infer the
geographic range of the various effects under scrutiny.
