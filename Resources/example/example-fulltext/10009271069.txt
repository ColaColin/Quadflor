Economic Consequences of the UEFA 
Champions League for National 
Championships ? The Case of Germany? 
Abstract: Qualifying for and participating in the UEFA Champions League (UCL) is associated with gene-
rating large revenue flows. The fear of the football associations, some journalists and fans is that a 
permanent financial and sporting imbalance will be created between clubs qualifying for the UCL and 
the remaining clubs. This paper analyses the consequences of the UCL on the national championship in 
the German ?Bundesliga?. The first section shows a review of economic and sporting trends in the Bun-
desliga for the 1980-1997 period. Also main changes in the domestic championship are reviewed. In 
second section an analysis of the UCL with (a) regard to competitive balance and (b) with regard to 
general balance will be undertaken. An interesting question is whether clubs qualifying for the UCL 
differ from the other teams. Especially the question whether competitive balance changes when there 
is an imbalance in the financial situation of the clubs (enforced by the UCL) will be analyzed. The third 
section describes the regulatory mechanisms of the German Bundesliga like revenue sharing and the 
licensing system.

1.1.1 Review of Trends in the Domestic Championship for the 1980-
1997 Period 
This first section shows a review of economic and sporting trends in the 
Bundesliga for the 1980-1997 period. Also main changes in the domestic champi-
onship are reviewed. The Bundesliga started in August 1963. With exception of 
the first two seasons and the season 1991/92 always 18 teams participated. After

some success on international level1 German football becomes very popular at the 
end of the 1970?s and the beginning of the 1980?s. This can be confirmed by a 
glance on the development of the attendance at Bundesliga matches (see Fig-
ure 1). A peak can be seen at the end of the 1970?s with a beginning terrific de-
cline up to mid 1980?s. This decline can be awarded to the absence of sporting 
success of German football teams (especially on club level) and serious trouble 
with violence at the stadia (hooliganism). The comfort of the stadia build for the 
World Cup 1974 in Germany didn?t be up to standard at this time. Also the so 
called novelty effect of these stadia was ebbing.2

times between 1974 and 1976 and Hamburger SV wins the Cup Winners Cup in 1977 and the 
European Champions Clubs' Cup in 1983. Also Borussia M?nchengladbach wins the UEFA Cup

Fig. 2 Average Ticket Revenue per Team (in million ?), 1980/81?2004/05 
After a small local maximum after the more successful World Cup 1986 (loosing 
the final) the attendance started a tremendous increase. This increase often is 
related to the fact that in 1988 the TV rights were sold to a private TV station for 
the first time in the history of German football. The reason may be an advertising 
effect coming from a modern and hip presentation of the matches in the high-
light show ?ran? on Saturday evening at the network ?sat1?. This was a little bit 
surprising because most commentators expected a further decline due to the 
more appealing presentation of the matches (2006). Also the big success of the 
German national team at the World Cup 1990 in Italy had boosted the demand 
for tickets additionally. After a short period of decreasing attendance around the 
millennium average attendance grow to the highest amount ever: 37,806 specta-
tors per game in season 2004/05. This is more than twice as much as attendance 
in season 1988/89 when the increase started. Inter alia, the newly big increase 
after season 2000/01 can be traced back to the novelty effect of the new stadia 
build in the run-up to the FIFA World Cup 2006. 
After a period of nearly constant real ticket revenue per team during the 1980?s, 
this kind of revenue increased tremendous. The starting point of this increases 
also coincided with the beginning of the sale of the TV rights to a private network

for the first time. After a short stagnation at the end of the 1990?s ticket revenue 
increases again. This raise may to be due to the construction of the new stadia for 
the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Germany. In addition to a possible novelty effect even 
capacity effects and/or revenue effects resulting from more or more expensive 
seats (VIP boxes, business seats incl. catering, higher seating capacity, lower 
standing capacity).3 
The last main economic trend in the Bundesliga for the 1980-1997 period con-
cerns the revenue resulting from the sale of the TV rights. TV revenue increased 
since liberalisation of the German TV market. Prior to the mid 1980?s there was 
the monopoly on the supply side (DFB) and only two (friendly behaved) public 
networks on the demand side. Thus the growth rate of TV revenue wasn?t high. 
The situation changed completely as private networks were allowed to enter the 
thitherto regulated German TV market. During the first half of the 1980-1997 
period the growth rate was moderate. As the TV rights for the popular highlight 
show on Saturday evening (started between 18.00h and 18.30h) went from a 
public TV station (ARD) to a private TV station (RTL/UFA) in 1988 a first big in-
crease can be observed (+122 %). Another big boost of TV revenue is due to start 
of pay TV in Germany in the early 1990?s. In season 1991/92 the pay TV station 
?Premiere? begins with live coverage of league matches. Further driving power 
for the growth of the TV revenue results from digitalisation of TV and the possi-
bility to offer pay per view offer through ?Premiere? in the late 1990?s.

Now some short remarks on the sporting trends for the period in consideration 
shall be made. From 1980 to 1997 one club was extremely successful: Bayern 
Munich. During the span of 18 seasons this club wins 8 times the national cham-
pionship. But there were also other successful teams like Hamburger SV (two 
consecutive titles in the early 1980?s) and Borussia Dortmund (two consecutive 
titles in the mid 1990?s). The race for the championship often was close. For the 
Bundesliga no trend in competitive balance measured by the C5 ration and the C5 
index of Competitive Balance (CB) can be found (see Figure 5 and Figure 6). Even a 
more detailed econometric analysis of competitive balance (e.g. standard devia-
tion, ratio of standard deviation, concentration ratios, Herfindahl Hirschman In-
dex) made by FEDDERSEN & MAENNIG (2005) revealed no significant trends in 
competitive balance for the Bundesliga. 
Even some important other (non economic) changes occurred in the 1980-1997 
period. First of all not until 1981/82 the Bundesliga 2 was organised in form of a 
single league. Before, there were parallel leagues. Furthermore the system of 
relegation and promotion changed. For parts of the period in consideration there

had been two teams relegated regularly to Bundesliga 2. Additional the team that 
had finished Bundesliga in sixteenth place had to participate in a play off (two 
games, home and away) against the team that had finished Bundesliga 2 in third 
place. At least the three point rule was implemented in 1995/96. 
1.1.2 Present Day (since 1997) 
Prior to 1998 the German football clubs were classified as non-profit organiza-
tions.4 For this reason German Football clubs were not legally obliged to publish 
their accounts. At present only Borussia Dortmund, the only stock exchange listed 
German football club, must publish its accounts. Apart from some sporadic data 
available in newspapers, information on the financial situation of the individual 
clubs is rather limited. In particular, longitudinal data on individual clubs is still 
difficult to obtain (FRICK & PRINZ, 2006). Therefore the following section (1.1.2.1) 
is based on information published by the German Football League (DFL GmbH). In 
an annual publication aggregated data for the whole league from 1998/99 on-
wards is published. The subsequent section (1.1.2.2) is based on the annual report 
of the Borussia Dortmund GmbH & Co. KgaA (public limited company). The last 
section (1.1.2.3) considers data released by the UEFA. 
1.1.2.1 For Elite Domestic Championships 
To review the general economic trend in the Bundesliga it is necessary to analyse 
three main areas: structure of revenues, transfer activities and structure of ex-
penditure. Due to the special characteristics of the transfer activities it is impor-
tant to discuss them separately. 
 
                                                        
4  The General Meeting of the German Football Association (DFB) passed a resolution (?keynote 
paper?) on 24.10.1998 which created the legal preconditions to convert the professional player 
departments of football clubs into joint stock companies. Until 2004 only nine of the clubs 
changed their legal status (FRICK & PRINZ, 2006). The only football club to go one step further 
and risk registration on the stock market has been Borussia Dortmund (FEDDERSEN & MAEN-
NIG, 2004).

1.1.2.1.1 Structure of Revenue Excluding Transfers 
The revenue of German football clubs can be categorised in accordance with the 
scheme used by the DFL for the purposes of their licensing procedure. The reve-
nues are divided into six categories (match day, advertising/sponsoring, TV, mer-
chandising, transfers, and other). Table 1 contains the different revenue catego-
ries, with the exception of the transfer revenue. The period under consideration 
runs from 1998/99 to 2004/05. Data before 1998/99 is not available from the 
DFL. Match day revenue include, for example, ticket revenue. The category 
?other? contains, among other items, revenue arising from subsidiary companies, 
revenue from youth and amateur levels, and donations.

In the second column of Table 1 the total revenue, excluding transfers, is given. 
The total revenue has grown from ?577 million to ?1,237 million during the 
seven seasons under consideration, corresponding to an increase of 114 %. The 
importance of the different revenue categories has also changed over time. This 
changing composition of total revenue is illustrated in Figure 3.

Fig. 4 The Composition of Revenue, Excluding Transfers, in the Bundesliga, 
1998/99-2003/04 (in %) 
 
The mostly important revenue category for the Bundesliga is that flowing from 
television rights (denoted as ?TV? in Figure 3). This category?s revenue share has 
fluctuated somewhat over time, reaching a peak of 45 % in season 2000/01 and 
then falling back to 26 % in season 2004/05. After this 2000/01 peak TV revenue 
declined as a consequence of the insolvency of the Kirch group,5 who held the 
broadcasting rights between 1992 and 2002. In the aftermath of the so called 
?Kirch break up? TV revenues tumbled from over ?400 million to approximately 
?290 million per season. The second most important revenue category is advertis-
ing and sponsorship. As illustrated in Figure 3, a substantial increase has taken 
place in this category, amounting to a 167 % rise over seven seasons. This is espe-
cially remarkable in light of the weak performance of the entire advertising mar-
ket in Germany, which contracted by over 10 % in the same period (DFL, 2006, p. 
30) 
                                                        
5  The Kirch group was running, inter alia, the TV stations Sat1 (free to air, presenting the high-
light show) and Premiere (pay TV, broadcasting live).

1.1.2.1.2 Net Final Result of Transfer Activity 
Over the entire seven season time span, transfer expenditure has exceeded trans-
fer revenue. As a result the Bundesliga has built up a large deficit through transfer 
activities. This leads one to conclude that many high profile foreign players signed 
contracts over this period. This deficit grew until 2002/03, but after this season 
the deficit fell significantly. The reason for this may be an adjustment process in 
the aftermath of the Kirch break up. This is reflected in the fact that transfer ex-
penditure has fallen from its peak in 2002/03 of almost ?200 million to the pre-
sent level of ?140 million. Despite the Bosman ruling the transfer expenditure of 
the Bundesliga clubs is surprisingly high. The average transfer expenditure per 
club amounts ?7.8 million.

1.1.2.1.3 Structure of Expenditure Excluding Transfers 
Analogous to revenue, the expenditure of football clubs is also structured accord-
ing to the scheme used in the DFL licensing procedure. The expenditure is divided 
into five categories (labour, youth and amateur teams, match day, transfers, and 
other). The monetary amounts within each of the different categories are given in 
table 3. The category ?Labour? is further divided into sport referred expenditure 
and expenditure for the administration of the club. This category has only been 
organised in this way since 2001/02. As is the case with revenue, no expenditure 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 10 
 
data is available for seasons prior to1998/99. The category ?other? contains, 
among other items, depreciation on fixed assets and expenditure from other 
sports departments (e.g. handball, tennis, and athletics).

Source:  DFL (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006). 
As illustrated in Table 3, labour expenditure is the largest expenditure category. 
The total expenditure (excluding transfers) has grown from ?530 million to ?1.1 
billion over the period in question, representing an increase of 105%. One should 
remember that revenue increased by approximately 114% in the same period. 
The strong increase of match day expenditure is due to the completion of several 
new stadia (DFL, 2003, p. 12). Since Germany was chosen to host of the FIFA 
World Cup 2006 a boom in stadium building has occurred. Above ?1.4 billion was 
invested in the 12 world cup stadia, as well as substantial investment in several 
other stadia in cities which will not be hosting a world cup game.6 
In the aftermath of the Kirch break up Bundesliga clubs have reduced the share of 
the labour expenditure on total expenditure continuously. The highest share can 
be observed in 1998/99 (55.8 %) and 2000/01 (55.5 %). After 2000/01 labour ex-

penditure has fallen back to 45.6 % in season 2004/05. It can also be seen from 
Figure 4 that the share of the match day expenditure has grown over the 1998-
2005 period. The share of the expenditure on youth and amateur teams, however, 
has remained at a relatively low level of less than 5 % throughout the period in 
question.

1.1.2.2 For Clubs 
In the next step the analysis undertaken in section (1.1.2.1) will be analogously 
executed for the top five clubs of the Bundesliga. The top five clubs will be de-
fined through a synthesis of their results in the Bundesliga between 1993/94 and 
2004/05. The decisive criterion will be the ranking of each club at the end of the 
twelve seasons from 1993/94 and 2004/05. The league position at the end of the 
particular seasons is given in Table 4. In this table the clubs participating in all 
consecutive seasons in the Bundesliga are shown. As it can be easily seen Bayern 
Munich has been the most successful team, finishing first or second in ten of the 
twelve seasons. This means an average ranking of 1.83. The gap to the second

1.1.2.2.1 Structure of Revenue, Excluding Transfers 
As described previously, information on the financial situation of the individual 
clubs is rather limited and always incomplete. For this reason the following sec-
tions (1.1.2.2.1) and (1.1.2.2.2) are based on the data from the annual reports of 
Borussia Dortmund. The data for this club can be regarded as representative of 
the five clubs under consideration. Of course, inferences from this approach 
should be drawn with care as Borussia Dortmund is the only German club listed 
on the stock exchange. It must be pointed out that the displayed revenue in Table 
5 is not only revenue from the Bundesliga. Revenue from European cup competi-
tions is also included. Further differences also exist, for example, in the unique

fan drawing potential of this club.7 The design of Table 5 is chosen in an analo-
gous fashion to that of the fore-mentioned DFL licensing procedure. Obviously 
the substantial decline in TV revenues after the Kirch break up can be seen in the 
data of an individual club. In the wake of that debacle, sponsoring revenue has 
become the most important revenue category. The share of this revenue category 
accounted for 36.1 % of total revenue in 04/05. Even ?ticket sales? contributes a 
relevant share, accounting for approximately 24 %. The total ticket revenue ap-
pears to be relatively constant over time, with an average figure of ?17.6 million.

1.1.2.2.2 Net Final Result of Transfer Activity 
As discussed earlier, the net result of transfer activity in the Bundesliga has been 
negative throughout the period under consideration. Now the net final result of 
transfer activity of the top five clubs will be analysed. The data is available from 
the internet service ?www.transfermarkt.de?. There one can find listed all the 
individual transfers of Bundesliga clubs from 1990/91 to the present. The trans-
fers are documented in terms of old club, new club, and transfer fee. The data is 
                                                        
7  The average attendance per league game is one of the highest in European football. In season 
03/04 the average attendance amounts 78,808 (capacity utilisation of 93 %). This was re-
markably higher than the average attendance of any other European club as e.g. the second 
placed Real Madrid (70,990) or the third placed Manchester United (67,646).

authentic for the last few seasons but rather incomplete for seasons before 
1995/96. Thus only data for transfers occurring after this point in time are in-
cluded in the following analysis. In this section general economic trends in the 
Bundesliga since 1997 will be considered. 
Not all of the top five clubs exhibit just negative net final results of transfer activ-
ity. For example Werder Bremen, as a club with a small regional market, has in-
curred very small deficits of transfer activity or even a noticeable surplus for some 
of the seasons considered in Table 6. Only Bayern Munich, the most successful 
Bundesliga team and the club with the highest economic potential, has always 
endured a negative net final result of his transfer activity. The substantial deficits 
of Borussia Dortmund between 2001/02 and 2003/04 are due to the IPO on 31st 
October 2000.8 In 2004/05 Borussia Dortmund went in financial trouble and nar-
rowly avoided insolvency in March 2005. After this point, the deficit of transfer 
activity was immediately transformed into a large surplus.9 
                                                        
8  Some of the transfers in question here are those of Marcio Amoroso (?25 million), Thomas 
Rosicky (?14.5 million), Jan Koller (?10.7 million), Sunday Oliseh (?7.5 million) Thorsten Frings 
(?8.5 million), Henrique Ewerthon de Souza (?7.1 million). These transfers were completed in 
the four seasons after the IPO. 
9  The consolidation will be continued in the coming seasons. In season 2005/06 a surplus of ?2.5 
million will be realised. Further steps towards the consolidations will be, inter alia, the probable 
transfer of Thomas Rosicky to Atletico Madrid or Juventus Torino after season 05/06. The fee 
for this transfer will be around ?10 million.

1.1.2.2.3 Structure of Expenditure 
Availability of information on the expenditure of individual Bundesliga clubs is 
also quite limited. For this reason Borussia Dortmund will again be considered as 
a representative club. In the annual report of Borussia Dortmund there are eight 
expenditure categories. These categories (excluding transfers) are displayed in 
Table 7. An interesting category is that denoted as ?Labour?. The level of the la-
bour expenditure grew at a tremendous rate up to season 2002/03. After the 
fore-mentioned financial problems experienced by Borussia Dortmund this rapid 
growth of labour expenditure abated immediately and was in fact slashed by one 
third, with further consolidation planned. Moreover, match day expenditure has 
grown over the period in question. An increase of approximately ?18 million can 
be detected in this expenditure category. This increase is due to the stepwise ex-
tension of the ?Westfalen Stadion? (now named ?Signal Iduna Park?) from a ca-
pacity of 42,800 (1994/95) to a capacity of 83,000 (2002/03).

1.1.2.3 UCL Revenue for the Bundesliga 
To complete the illustration of the general economic trends in the Bundesliga it 
now remains to analyse UCL revenue and its distribution. This revenue flow is of 
immense importance to the Bundesliga due, quite simply, to the vast sums of 
money involved.

HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 17 
 
The period under consideration here spans from 1996/97 to 2004/05. During this 
period nine different Bundesliga clubs qualified for the UCL. Bayern Munich took 
part in the competition eight times out of a possible nine, followed by Bayer 
Leverkusen (6 times) and Borussia Dortmund (5 times). Two clubs have won the 
UCL: Borussia Dortmund (96/97) and Bayern Munich (00/01). The German clubs 
also lost two finals during the considered period: Bayern Munich against Man-
chester United (98/99) and Bayer Leverkusen against Real Madrid (01/02). A fur-
ther six teams only participated once in the UCL. On one occasion the team which 
finished in third place failed to qualify for the UCL in the qualification round and 
then had to enter the UEFA cup (Borussia Dortmund 03/04). 
Bayern Munich received the most money over the seven seasons, with a total 
amount of about ?173 million or ?24.7 million per season. In second place of this 
ranking stands Bayer Leverkusen, with more than ?105 million or more than ?15 
million per season. The largest amount of UCL revenue secured in a single season 
was also achieved by Bayern Munich. In the season of their UCL victory (2000/01) 
they amassed almost ?47 million. The lowest revenue from participating in the 
UCL received 1. FC Kaiserslautern in season 1998/99. Over the whole period the 
total UCL revenue equals 6.4 % of the total overall revenue (excluding transfers) 
of the Bundesliga. This share is surprisingly small ? football fans would expect 
that the impact of the UCL on the total revenue would be very significant. How-
ever, for a more differentiated analysis the total amount of the UCL revenue must 
not be considered in isolation. The distribution of UCL revenue among the indi-
vidual teams must also be analysed. When such a differentiated analysis is under-
taken the apprehensions of fans and league officials is found to be confirmed. 
The distribution is indeed skewed. This imbalance can be captured neatly by the 
Gini coefficient, which stands at 0.529 among the teams qualified for the UCL but 
0.764 among the 18 teams of the Bundesliga.

1.2 Changes in Competitive Balance 
1.2.1 Rankings 
If the rankings at the end of the last 15 seasons are considered, one club appears 
to be dominant: Bayern Munich. This club has reached the top three 13 times and 
top two twelve times. The average ranking of Bayern Munich is 2.4. The next suc-
cessful club, Borussia Dortmund, has an average ranking of 4.7. Bayern Munich 
has won the championship seven times over the last 15 seasons. At first glance 
the Bundesliga appears to be extremely unbalanced. But from another point of 
view Bayern Munich has not won the championship on eight occasions over this 
same period. Some other teams have achieved Bundesliga success, for example, 
Borussia Dortmund (three times), Werder Bremen (twice), 1. FC Kaiserslautern 
(twice), and VfB Stuttgart (once). There are also a number teams which, while 
without actually winning the championship, have been successful none-the-
less ? such as Bayer Leverkusen with an average ranking of 5.5. This club has fin-
ished seven times in the top three. In most seasons the race for the championship 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 19 
 
was open until the very end of the season. It is evident from the nature of this 
Bundesliga ranking that more analytical tools such as measures of competitive 
balance can be usefully constructed to undertake this analysis.

1.2.2 Calculation of C5 Ratio and C5 Index of Competitive Balance 
Competitive balance can be measured in a number of ways. For this purpose the 
Cm ratio can be used. This measure is well known as a tool for assessing concen-
tration in industrial markets. The concentration ratio Cm captures the summed 
market shares of the m biggest companies. So the ratio C5 shows the cumulated 
market shares of the top five clubs of the football league in question. The choice 
of setting m equal to five can be justified by the structure of the sporting compe-
tition. Teams that finish in one of these top five positions qualify for one of the 
UEFA European cup competitions. So this measure shows whether imbalances 
between European cup participants and the other teams do in fact arise or even 
increase. In Figure 5 the development of the C5 ratio is displayed.

Bundesliga this is not a significant problem, as the number of teams is near stable 
during the 42 seasons of the Bundesliga?s existence.10 However, the relevance of 
this problem does arise if one wishes to compare leagues with different numbers 
of participants. A convenient solution is to calculate the so called ?C5 index of 
competitive balance?. 
 
C5
C5 index of CB 
5 N
=  (2) 
The C5 index consists of both the concentration ratio mentioned earlier and N, 
the number of teams playing in the league during the considered season. Not 
surprisingly the correlation between the C5 ratio and the C5 index of CB is high 
for the Bundesliga (0.871). Figure 6 shows the development of the C5 index of CB.

were there 16 teams. The season 1991/92 was played with 20 teams due to German unifica-
tion.

HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 22 
 
The insights captured by Figures 3 and 4 lead one to conclude that there is no dis-
tinct trend in the competitive balance of the Bundesliga. The econometric analy-
sis of FEDDERSEN (2008) showed that there is indeed no significant trend. Thus it 
can be seen the establishment of the UCL in the early 1990?s did not lead to 
changes in competitive balance of the Bundesliga. 
1.2.3 Proportion of Clubs Qualifying for UCL 
Figure 7 shows the individual clubs proportion of total Bundesliga club budgets 
for season 2004/05. The budget of Germany?s most successful club (Bayern Mu-
nich; finished first) was the largest of all the Bundesliga clubs. But the distance to 
the club with the second highest budget (Hertha BSC Berlin; finished fourth) was 
quite small (9.0 % to 8.2 %). The lowest share was observed for Arminia Bielefeld 
with 3.3 %. The UCL clubs command an average share of 7.1 % while the runners 
up (from fourth to ninth place) possess an average share of 6.7 %. From tenth 
place down, however, there was a remarkable break in club budgets. The average 
share of the remaining nine teams correspond to 4.3 % of total Bundesliga club 
budgets. It can be seen that the budget of the UCL teams is not evidently higher 
than the budget of the runners up. So, crucially, the break is not determined after 
third place.

Analogously, a study of the growing imbalance in transfer expenditure can be 
undertaken. In light of this, the relation between UCL participation and transfer 
expenditure should be analysed. Sometimes football associations worry about a 
growing gap in talent distribution among the teams of their leagues due to ex-
cessive transfer activities of the top clubs. A glance at Figure 8 may confirm this 
impression. The cumulative share of transfer expenditure of the three clubs quali-
fied for the UCL in season 2004/05 accounted for approximately 50 %. The big-
gest share belongs to Bayern Munich with 30.2 %. Taking this season as an exam-
ple, it can be shown that evidence exists of a large difference between transfer 
expenditure of teams qualifying for UCL and other teams. Figure 8 illustrates the 
development of the relative transfer expenditure. Not surprisingly, the transfer 
expenditure of UCL clubs is higher than that of teams outside of the UCL qualifi-
cation positions. For the period 1996/97 to 2004/05 the transfer expenditure of 
these teams was, at least, approximately twice as much as the league average. 
Thus the large difference in existing transfer expenditure patterns can be con-
firmed. However with respect to the trends of the period in question there is no 
evidence of this imbalance growing in size. On the contrary, a slight decline in 
relative transfer expenditure of UCL clubs can be observed from this data.

2 Analysis of Impact of UCL on the Domestic Championship 
In this section an analysis of the UCL with (a) regard to competitive balance and 
(b) with regard to general balance will be undertaken. An interesting question is 
whether clubs qualifying for the UCL differ from the other teams. There are three 
main areas which should be considered in greater detail: the budget, the trans-
fers and the share of TV rights. 
As discussed earlier, qualifying for and participating in UCL is associated with 
generating large revenue flows. The fear of the football associations, some jour-
nalists and fans is that a permanent financial and sporting imbalance will be cre-
ated between clubs qualifying for the UCL and the remaining clubs. To check 
whether this fear is justified or not three kinds of relationships will be empirically 
tested: tests of the relationship between 1) competitive balance and budget, 
transfers, TV rights, 2) between qualification for UCL and budget and 3) qualifica-
tion for UCL and transfers will be conducted.

2.1.1 Test of Relationship between Competitive Balance and Budget, 
Transfers, TV Rights 
This section tests whether competitive balance changes when there is an imbal-
ance in the financial situation of the clubs. The financial situation is embodied in 
(a) the budget, (b) the transfer expenditure, and (c) the TV revenue. To measure 
the imbalance of the financial indicators their Gini coefficients were calculated 
for each season. To analyse the fore-mentioned relationship the trends of the Gini 
coefficients and competitive balance over the seasons are examined. In the first 
step the correlation between the Gini coefficients on the one hand and the meas-
ures of competitive balance (C5 and C5 index of CB) is computed. The results, 
which are displayed in Table 10, show very small values for correlation coeffi-
cients. Furthermore none of the correlation coefficients is significant at the 0.05 
level. 
To test causality, as distinct from correlation, the Granger test can be conducted. 
The results of the granger causality tests are given in Table 11. None of the test 
statistics are significant; at least at the 10 % level. This applies for the C5 ratio as 
well as for the C5 index of CB. It can be concluded therefore that no causal rela-
tionship exists between competitive balance and the financial balance and vice 
versa.

2.1.2 Test of Relationship between Qualification for UCL and Budget 
Although there is no obvious relationship between competitive balance and fi-
nancial balance, it should be analysed whether qualification for UCL affects the 
budget of Bundesliga teams, and vice versa. The supposed relationship between 
qualification for UCL and the budget size of these clubs is displayed in Figure 9. 
There the relative budget of all Bundesliga clubs for the 24 season in question is 
given on the y-axis and the ranking on the x-axis. The scatter plot exhibits a visual 
coherence. A linear regression yields a negative relation. The corresponding R? has 
a value of merely 0.36. Thus the quality of the relationship isn?t very high. It also 
can be seen that the bandwidth of the budget which the champion has com-
manded is wide. 
Even a study of the relative budget trends of teams qualifying for the UCL and the 
other teams cannot confirm the thesis of growing financial imbalance (see Figure 
10). It can be seen that the difference between the UCL clubs and the others was 
more pronounced in the mid 1980?s. From the early 1990?s, when the UCL was 
established, the proportion of the relative budget has been almost constant. It is 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 27 
 
shown clearly that no trend is present for the period 1992/93 to 2004/05. Thus no 
evidence for the thesis presented above could be found.

2.1.3 Test of Relationship between Qualification for UCL and Transfers 
Figure 11 provides a scatter plot of the relationship between qualification for UCL 
and the transfer expenditure. On the y-axis of this diagram the relative transfer 
expenditure is shown, while the ranking is displayed again on the x-axis. This re-
lationship does not appear to be very strong. Indeed the slope of the linear trend 
line is negative, as one would expect. However, the corresponding R? is very small 
(0.23). In particular, the range of the transfer expenditure for the top clubs is very 
wide. For the first placed team it can vary from nearly zero to nearly six with one 
representing the average transfer expenditure. It is also remarkable that none of 
the teams later relegated have had a relative transfer expenditure of above one, 
i.e. their transfer activity was always below the average. However, this of course 
does not mean that a team with substandard transfer expenditure will be rele-
gated with certainty. 
A glance at the trends in relative transfer expenditure of teams qualified for the 
UCL and the other teams (see Figure 12) also contradict the thesis of an growing 
imbalance. The difference between UCL clubs and the other clubs was much lar-
ger at the beginning of the period in question. After 1995/96 the gap between 
these two categories declined almost continuously, with a little counter move-
ment at the end. Thus there no evidence for growing imbalance in transfer ex-
penditure can be found.

diture can be found. Furthermore no substantially higher TV revenues result from 
finishing a season in a top position, as opposed to those finishing in the remain-
ing UCL qualification places. As intermediate result it can be seen that no evi-
dence exists of a noticeable effect of the UCL on the analysed areas. 
3 Regulatory mechanisms 
3.1 Presentation of National Mechanisms 
3.1.1 Solidarity (Sharing of Revenue) 
The most important revenue sharing agreement is the central marketing of the 
TV rights. The TV rights for the Bundesliga are sold collective by the German 
Football Association (DFB) and since independence by the DFL. Up to the end of 
the 1990?s the revenue from TV rights were shared between Bundesliga (first di-
vision) and Bundesliga 2 (second division), with Bundesliga receiving 66.6 % and 
Bundesliga 2 receiving 33.3 %. The allocation between the clubs in each division 
was then conducted equally. Since 2000 the TV revenues are shared 77.5 % (first 
division) to 22.5 % (second division). 50 % of the contingent of the Bundesliga is 
shared equally among the clubs, while a further 37.5 % are distributed according 
to the sporting success over the past three years. The remaining 12.5 % is allo-
cated considering the actual league table position as of each match day (HOLZ-
H?USER, 2004, p. 19). In the Bundesliga there are no noteworthy revenues gener-
ated by finishing a season in a top position additional to those revenues achieved 
by the UCL participation. For this reason the proportion of the TV revenues sold by 
the DFB/DFL of the clubs qualified for the UCL is not important in assessing the 
impact of the UCL for the Bundesliga. Other kinds of revenue sharing are more or 
less meaningless. No gate sharing is practiced in the Bundesliga.11 From mid to 
the end of the 1990?s a solidarity fund existed. Clubs participating in the UCL 
shared 20 % of their UCL revenue. Clubs participating in the UEFA cup paid ?0.5 
million per game but maximum ?2 million per season. This solidarity fund was 
                                                        
11  For matches of the DFB cup the gate revenue will be shared between the two opponents and 
the DFB. 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 31 
 
cancelled after the readjustment of the national TV revenue in 2000 (HOLZ-
H?USER, 2004, p. 19). 
3.1.2  Training (Training Centers/Academies) 
All clubs of the Bundesliga and Bundesliga 2 are obliged to keep a youth training 
centre. The aim of these centres is to ensure a high quality training of talented 
players of the different age groups.12 The clubs have to mange at minimum seven 
teams and at maximum nine teams in the youth and amateur area. Some struc-
tural conditions have to be fulfilled by the 18 clubs of the Bundesliga.13 The condi-
tions can be structured as follows (syllabus): 
- Training compound: 3 pitches, 2 of them with floodlight, the possibil-
ity to use an indoor pitch. 
- Sporting care: 3 full-time coaches (one of them has to be the director 
of the centre), 1 goalkeeper coach. 
- Medical care: 1 medical doctor, 1 physical therapist, 1 diploma trainer 
or physical therapist as coach for condition and rehabilitation. 
- Non-sporting care: A pedagogical expedient care has to be ensured 
(e.g. residential school, host parents). 
- Educational care: Cooperation between a school and the club has to 
be arranged. There should be additional training sessions offered by 
this school. Also the sporting demands should be coordinated with 
the academic requirements. 
These training centres will be inspected by a commission of the league associa-
tion ever year. A memorandum will be provided to the DFL for the purpose of the 
licensing procedure. 
                                                        
12  This is fixed in the licensing principle (?3 II Lizenzordnung). 
13  The conditions for the clubs of Bundesliga 2 are less strict and won?t be presented in detail. 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 32 
 
3.1.3 Financial Control (Institutions and Procedures) 
The following details base upon the German paper ?cost control and competition 
protection by a licensing procedure? from M?LLER (2003).14 
There are three institutions involved in the licensing procedure. Prior to the end of 
the 1990?s the DFB was responsible institution. Since independence of the league 
two institutions process the licensing procedure: The so called ?league associa-
tion? (Ligaverband e.V.) and the DFL GmbH.15 The license will be granted by the 
board of directors of the league association but the licensing procedure will be 
undertaken by the DFL. 
This licensing procedure isn?t only based on economic criteria but it is the most 
important. Additionally the clubs have to fulfil sporting, technical, organizational, 
and infrastructural conditions. Since the clubs normally fulfil these additional cri-
teria and the critical hurdle often exists in the economic conditions, only these 
conditions shall be considered in the next remarks. The aim of the DFL licensing 
procedure is, first of all, to guarantee that a started season will be finished regu-
larly. Non club shall be gone bankrupt during a season. Thereby stability, integ-
rity, and continuity will be ensured. 
The following documents have to be added by the individual clubs: 
- An audited balance sheet (dated: 31.12.t-1) 
- A profit and loss statement for the last season (01.07.t-2 to 30.06.t-1) 
and for the first half of the actual season (01.07.t-1 to 31.12.t-1) 
- A review of the economic situation by the board of directors 
                                                        
14  The author is executive director for finance, administration and accounting at the DFL and his 
department is responsible for the financial aspects of the licensing procedure. 
15  The league association is a self-contained member of the DFB. All 36 clubs of the Bundesliga 
and Bundesliga 2 are members of it. The DFL GmbH conducts the operative business of the 
league association. The league association is the only shareholder of the DFL GmbH. 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 33 
 
- A planed profit and loss statement for the second half of the actual sea-
son (01.01.t to 30.06.t) and for the next season (01.07.t to 30.06.t+1) 
These documents have to be declared plausible by a certified accountant. Beyond 
this the applicant has to present a set of legally binding declarations. The club 
have to: 
- commit themselves to provide important contracts in the field of mar-
keting and sports. 
- assure that at 31.12.t-1 all accrued liabilities to the employee and all 
taxes on wages will be paid. 
- assure that at 31.12.t-1 all accrued transfer fees will be paid. 
- absolve its credit institutions from banker's secrecy to the league asso-
ciation. 
- allow the DFL to request the responsible tax office for information. 
- disclose all investments in other companies. 
- commit themselves to keep the (possible) licensing conditions. 
Based on these documents the DFL is checking the economic ability of the clubs. 
The priority goal for this evaluation is the liquidity of the club applying for a li-
cense. Starting from the audited liquid assets at 31.12.t-1 all transactions affect-
ing payment will be considered and a balance of liquidity will be calculated. If the 
economic ability is inexistent the license won?t be granted or will be granted with 
conditions. Furthermore the function of the equity capital as a risk buffer and li-
ability bulk will be regarded. A breach of the extended conditions results in sanc-
tions like a formal reprimand, a monetary penalty or even deduction of points 
and, in the worst case, the withdrawal of the license. 
In addition to the licensing procedure a system of security deposit exists in Ger-
man professional football since the 1980?s. The clubs are obliged to keep a cash 
bond on a DFL trust account. The amount of this cash bond has to be as high as 
the labour expenditure of one month. 
HCED 01/2006 ? Economic Consequences of the UCL for National Championships 34 
 
3.2 Impact of UEFA Licence 
In Germany there will be no additional licensing procedure implemented. The 
clubs will be controlled by the national licensing procedure which is correspond-
ing to the requirements of the UEFA. A granted national license simultaneous will 
be a granted licence for an European cup competition. Since the licensing proce-
dure in Germany is running for a long time there are no expected and observed 
impacts of the UEFA license on the Bundesliga. But for the international compari-
son some sports functionaries and fans have the hope that the international 
competitiveness of the German clubs will be improved. This hope is accorded to 
the fear that foreign clubs operating at deficit won?t be controlled effectively and 
thus received a competitive advantage over the mentioned German clubs. But 
there isn?t still enough time gone to examine these expected effects.
