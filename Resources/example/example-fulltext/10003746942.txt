Abstract
Rural poverty remains one of the biggest challenges in development. It is generally 
recognized that land reform, in combination with complementary support services and 
infrastructure development, is effective in reducing rural poverty; however, empirical 
evidence on the extent of the impacts is limited as are the pathways by which the impacts 
reach the beneficiaries.  
This study assesses the impacts of rural infrastructure and supported services provided by 
the Agrarian Reform Communities Project (ARCP) and financed jointly by the Government of 
the Philippines and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Using data from the same 2,290 
agrarian reform beneficiaries? households from two periods, 2001 and 2003, the study found 
that average annual income increased by 12%. Ownership of both household and production 
assets increased significantly.  
Among the project interventions, farm-to-market roads appeared to have the most significant 
impact on the communities. The benefits of the project interventions, however, were 
disproportionately captured by the wealthier households, resulting in worsened income 
distribution in the communities. In the transformation from labor use to more mechanized 
modes of production and transportation, the poor, i.e., the wage laborers, generally lose out, 
at least temporarily. Future interventions in rural infrastructure provisions should include 
measures to assist the poor to increase their capacity to capture the new employment 
opportunities generated by development interventions.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Agrarian reform is recognized as a prerequisite for growth with equity in developing countries 
as evidenced in Japan, Republic of Korea, Taipei,China, and People?s Republic of China, 
which have successfully implemented this reform (Morales, 1999). The redistribution of land 
helps reduce poverty by granting full ownership and control to the farmer-beneficiaries and 
providing the necessary support services and infrastructure to make the land productive, 
while laying the foundation for broad-based development. Through successful 
implementation of land reform programs, these countries have achieved sustained 
economic growth and successfully reduced absolute material poverty among their populace. 
Rural poverty is a serious problem in the Philippines, and the Agrarian Reform Communities 
(ARC) are among the most disadvantaged population groups. Baseline studies conducted in 
1997 by the University of the Philippines Los Ba?os determined that more than 70% of 
agrarian household members lived below the poverty line. In US equivalents, the average 
agrarian household annual income was US$792.72 compared with the national poverty 
threshold of US$1378.36. Recognizing that poverty is most prevalent among landless farm 
workers and sharecroppers, the government?s dominant way of addressing poverty has been 
to transfer ownership and control of land assets to such agricultural reform beneficiaries. An 
integral component of land distribution is the provision of rural infrastructure and support 
services to complement agricultural productivity and enhance welfare of impoverished farm 
workers and sharecroppers. 
Jointly funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of the Philippines 
and commenced under the umbrella of the government?s ARC development strategy, the 
Agrarian Reform Community Project (ARCP), begun in 2000, aims to alleviate poverty 
through the provision of rural infrastructure and other support services. The investment 
project was a loan of about US$72.6 million, 72% of which is allocated for rural 
infrastructure. The project also enhances community participation in the transition from 
subsistence to commercial farming. 
This paper attempts to determine the impacts of the ARCP, in particular the rural 
infrastructure, on ARC households after two years of implementation. The paper also 
evaluates how project benefits are distributed among different population groups. 
A. Poverty in the Philippines 
Thirty percent of the 2003 population lived below the poverty line; this translates to 3.96 
million families living below the poverty line.1 A majority of the poor are in Mindanao, where 
more than 40% of families have difficulty providing for everyday needs. According to De Dios 
(1993), the incidence of poverty is highest among landless farm workers, then coconut and 
maize farmers, fishermen, rice farmers, and, lastly, orchard growers. Table 1 shows that 
while overall poverty has declined in the country since 1985, the decline is more in urban 
than in rural areas.

1 The National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) defines the poverty line as the cost of basic food and non-
food requirements (valued in pesos). In the Philippine official methodology, the poverty line may be viewed as 
the minimum income required to meet the food requirements and other non-food basic needs (NSCB, 1997).

B. The Agrarian Reform Community Project and Its Interventions 
With the aim of reducing poverty among the most disadvantaged communities in the 
Philippines, the government has launched a number of projects. The ARCP is one such 
project design based on the ARC development strategy and the overarching goal of poverty 
reduction of the ADB (ADB, 1999). 
Previously, agrarian reform in the Philippines failed since land distribution was not 
complemented by support services and infrastructure development. Under the present 
ARCP, many beneficiaries have already received land titles. ARCs, however, remain without 
much-needed infrastructure, e.g., farm-to-market roads, potable water, communal irrigation, 
and supported services. 
The ARCP is aiming to reduce the poverty of around 200,000 people in 140 ARCs in 35 
provinces with specific emphasis in Mindanao (50% of total investment) and Visayas 
(21.5%), where the incidence of poverty is remarkably high (Figure 1). The ARCP aims to 
reduce poverty by providing infrastructure and by developing support services for agricultural 
enterprises and a capability-building program for Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) 
staff, local government units, and ARC organizations (ADB, 1998).

In 2000, the project began with the provision of rural infrastructure as its largest component. 
The project?s three major development interventions include: 
1. Rehabilitation/construction of approximately 1,500 km of farm-to-market roads 
(FMR) including bridges, the majority of which are barangay roads connecting 
production areas in the ARCs to major market centers; 
2. Rehabilitation/construction of approximately 6,500 hectares of communal 
irrigation systems to augment productivity and land quality by increasing cropping 
intensity; and  
3. Development of about 900 potable water supply (PWS) systems to cut morbidity 
rates in half and decrease the time it takes to obtain water, benefiting a total of 
37,600 households (225,600 persons). 
4. Community Strengthening and Introduction of Income Earning Activities to 
support community organizations such as cooperatives and to introduce income 
earning activities such as production of high-value crops.

C. Data Background 
In 2001, a baseline survey collected information on 13,000 rural agrarian households in the 
ARCP area. A survey revisited 2,290 households in 2003. A subset of households with data 
for both 2001 and 2003 was extracted for this study. Forty percent of the sample is from 
Mindanao and the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), while 30% each came 
from Luzon and Visayas. Table 3 shows the geographical distribution of respondents.

D. Methodology 
To assess project impacts on households in the project area, the study examines the 
changes in key household characteristics before and after project interventions, using simple 
statistical analysis. It then assesses the probability of a household moving into a non-poor 
category in 2003, given its attributes in 2001, in order to identify key characteristics which 
affect the move.

such as age and education of household head, the household?s production system, its asset 
ownership, and transportation access. 
II. POVERTY IN AGRARIAN REFORM COMMUNITIES IN 2001 AND 2003 
This section provides a descriptive analysis of the agrarian households included in the 2001 
and 2003 surveys. It describes the differences in household incomes, asset holdings, 
expenditures, and agricultural practices, among others, between the two periods. 
ARC households are smallholder households with agriculture as their main source of 
income. The average household head in the ARCP area in 2001 was 49.1 years of age, 
owned 1.15ha of land, and had 5.2 people in his/her family. In terms of education, a total of 
95% completed elementary-level education, and 48% attended high school or had higher-
level education. These characteristics did not change over the period of the project?s 
intervention. 
To review the household welfare characteristics that changed between the two periods, we 
first examined the household income. All income indicators in 2003 are expressed in real 
terms of constant market prices in 2001. Net annual household income was 66,029 pesos in 
2001. After two years of the ARCP implementation, total household income increased by 
12% to 73,904 pesos in 2003. The on-farm income increased by 39% during this timeframe, 
while the non-farm and the off-farm income decreased by 23% and 11%, respectively. 
Notable is the immediate increase in on-farm income, reflecting the importance of agriculture 
as the main income-generating activity for the ARCP households (Table 4). 
ADBI Discussion Paper 110  Sununtar Setboonsarng

Table 4: Household Profile in 2001 
The increase in on-farm income is most likely a direct result of the ARCP?s interventions. 
Along with improvement of infrastructure, the ARCP introduced high-value vegetable 
production for local markets. The new income-earning opportunities in agriculture allowed 
household members who used to work as wage laborers to refocus on on-farm activities 
(Figure 2 and Table 5.)

A. Change in Agriculture Practice Between Two Periods 
In agrarian reform, change in agricultural practices has strong impact on income change 
(Evenson, 1986). In the households surveyed, most households in Luzon grew rice while 
households in Visayas grew sugar cane and maize. Of the on-farm income in 2001 and 
2003, the share of income from rice decreased by 5% while the share of income from sugar 
cane, maize, and other crops increased. It is possible that the decrease in the share of 
income from rice was brought about by the slight decrease in the average price per kilogram 
of unprocessed rice. Additionally, the areas of maize, sugar cane, and cash-crop production 
expanded. Concurrently, average prices for maize and cash crops increased in 2003 (Figure 
3).
Figure 3: Share of On-farm Income in 2001 and 2003 
2001
Income from Rice Income from Maize
Income from Sugarcane Income from Others
2003
NOTE: Income from Others includes income from growing bananas and vegetables. 
While the total area and number of croppings increased for all crops except for maize, 
production costs decreased for all crop types. Major production cost items that have been 
reduced are: rental land, seedlings, hired labor, and equipment rental, and also certain 
reductions in the shares of harvesters, threshers, and ?other costs? (including transportation 
and hauling and other incidental expenses). Average reduction in ?other costs,? for instance, 
ranged from 55% (for rice) to 100% (for bananas). The reduction in seedling costs ranged 
from 69% to 99% for unprocessed rice, maize, sugar cane, and bananas. Better road access 
not only reduced transportation costs of inputs but also allowed for increased competition 
among suppliers of inputs. In many cases, community organizations, e.g., cooperatives, 
utilized the improved roads to purchase inputs in bulk, further lowering input costs.

1. Rice 
Rice is the basic staple in the Philippines?a total of 1,507 of the households sampled (58%) 
produce rice. The average area planted with rice increased by 25%, and the number of 
croppings increased by 8% between 2001 and 2003. Notably, the total rice yield per area (in 
multi-croppings) increased by 14%, which contributed partly to the 44% increase in net 
income from rice. The expansion of rice production area is due to improved irrigation 
systems, which allow for dry-season cropping. There was also a 19% decrease in the cost of 
production due to the lower cost of seedlings, hired labor, and ?other costs,? particularly, 
transportation and hauling (Table 6). 
Table 6: Characteristics of Rice Production 
*Total yield of multiple croppings. 
2. Maize 
Maize is the second most important crop, particularly in the rain-fed areas of Visayas and 
Mindanao. Of the 667 households (26%) that farmed maize in the surveyed group, the 
average area used for planting maize increased by 5%. The number of croppings 
decreased, reflecting the change in land use. The yield per area (in multi-croppings) 
increased by 10%, leading to a 57% increase in net income. There was also a 10% 
decrease in the cost of production during the period due to reduction in the cost of seeds, 
?other costs,? and hired labor. The increased maize yield, net income, and reduction in cost 
of seeds may have benefited from the Department of Agriculture?s hybrid corn production 
program, launched nationwide in 2002, which propagates the use of drought- and nitrogen-
stress-resistant corn varieties (Table 7).

3. Sugar Cane 
Of the surveyed households, 140 were engaged in sugar cane production. The area of sugar 
cane production increased by 0.7ha (46%), while the number of croppings increased 4%. 
The yield per area (in multi-croppings) increased by 12%, contributing to a net income 
increase of 134%. Due to lower seed cost, ?other costs,? irrigation fees, reduced harvest 
costs, rental land, and equipment rental, the cost of production dropped 23% (Table 8).

4. Bananas 
Bananas are the main Mindanao export crop, accounting for 336 of the surveyed 
households. The average area increased by 53%, and the number of croppings increased by 
6%. The banana yield per area (in multi-croppings) increased by 112%, while the net income 
from banana cultivation increased by 247%. A 46% decrease in production costs decreased 
due to reductions in ?other costs,? seeds, and rental land (Table 9).

B. Movements In and Out of Poverty 
To assess the project?s impact on poverty, we disaggregated the household data into ?poor? 
and ?non-poor? households. Poor households are those with a net income below the 2001 
poverty line. 2  On average, non-poor households in 2001 possessed slightly more land 
holdings and had larger families than the poor. The non-poor also have 72% higher total 
household income, and the household heads have a higher level of education than the poor 
(Table 10).

Table 11 shows that from 2001 to 2003 on-farm income of poor households increased by 
46%, while the non-farm and the off-farm income of poor households decreased by 6% and 
32%, respectively. For non-poor households, the on-farm income increased by 49%, while 
the non-farm and the off-farm income decreased by 9% and 11%, respectively. Both 
household categories experienced substantial increases in household incomes, while off-
farm incomes decreased significantly in poor households and to a much lesser extent in non-
poor households.

Since expenditure data is known to be a better measure of welfare changes, changes in 
household expenditures merited examination (Figure 4). In poor households, total 
expenditure increased by 4,772P (11%) while their food expenditure share declined by 9%. 
In non-poor households, total expenditure increased by 9,107 P (12%), while their food 
expenditure declined by 5%.

Food Education Health Payment of loans Others
These changes are consistent with Engel?s Law, which suggests that the share of 
expenditure for food products declines when a family?s income increases. Between the two 
groups, the poor have spent a lesser proportion of their income increase on food and more 
on health, payment of loans, and others (items not classified as basic necessities and 
possibly including materials for production and consumer durables). Notable is the decline in 
the proportion of education expenses. For non-poor, the increase was primarily spent on 
others and payment of loans. The proportion of education and health expenses declined 
slightly by 0.5% in the non-poor group. For both groups, the increase in income produced 
overall increases in the proportion of expenditure for ?others.? The expenditure by the poor 
on ?others? increased significantly at 8%, while the increase for the non-poor for the same 
category increased by 4%.

C. Change in Asset Holdings 
1. Household Assets 
Change in wealth status can also be based on change in ownership of household assets. 
Figure 5 displays the change in ownership of selected household durables, e.g., TVs, radios, 
refrigerators, and electric fans.3 Both poor and non-poor households showed significant 
increases in the ownership of the selected household assets. The incremental change in the 
assets of non-poor households is larger than that of the poor households, except for radios.

2. Production Assets 
Another indicator of welfare change is investment in agriculture systems. Figure 6 indicates 
the level of ownership of selected production assets, such as generators, hand tractors, 
rotary tillers, and threshers, and the corresponding changes in ownership after two years.
Unlike the magnitude of change in household assets, the increase in the ownership of 
production assets among both poor and non-poor households is negligible. The change in 
the ownership of hand tractors among the non-poor was the highest at 1.4%, but even this 
increase is insignificant compared to the changes in household assets.

3. Transportation Assets 
With rural infrastructure in place, one would expect households to invest more in 
transportation assets. Figure 7 displays the change in ownership of selected transportation 
modes, including cars, motorcycles, bicycles, jeeps, and carts. In general, non-poor 
households can afford more jeeps, motorcycles, and bicycles than poor households. The 
incremental change in car ownership is the greatest for both poor and non-poor, although 
the ownership rate was under 10%.

D. Change in PovertyLevel 
Particularly striking is the decrease in poverty levels in the ARCP areas while the national 
poverty level increased. Between 2001 and 2003, rural poverty at the national level 
increased by 9%, climbing from 46.9% to 55.9%. In contrast, the poverty incidence declined 
slightly from 60.5% to 59.7% in the ARCP areas. About 489 poor households moved above 
the poverty line, while 468 non-poor households moved below the poverty line. 
Changes in the magnitude and the direction of poverty within poor households differ among 
regions (Table 12). From 2001 to 2003, the number of households falling below the poverty 
line increased in Luzon and ARMM, while decreasing in Visayas and Mindanao. The 
incremental change of 7% in Mindanao was the largest, while more households in Luzon 
became poor during the period.

Resurvey, 2003 57% 71% 53% 64% 60%
E. Change in Income Distribution 
Although increases in average income levels have been observed, this does not necessarily 
indicate that income levels proportionately increased in all household categories. The Gini 
coefficient of total household incomes was calculated (Table 13). The income distribution 
deteriorated for all of the samples, including poor and non-poor categories, for the period 
2001?2003. This finding suggests that income distribution slightly worsened as a result of 
project interventions.

F. Change in Expenditures 
Figure 8 displays the difference in household expenditures by the expenditure deciles for the 
period 2001?2003. Approximately 60% of poor households experienced a decrease in 
expenditures, while those at the top 20% had an increase in expenditure levels. Note that 
the poverty line roughly coincides with the threshold of 60% deciles. The households that fell 
within those deciles suffered a decline in household expenditures. This implies that only the 
non-poor households possessing incomes above the poverty line enjoy a higher or at least 
the same level of expenditures after two years of the ARCP intervention.

In summary, as a result of the ARCP implementation, there were increases in: 
 Total household income 
 On-farm income 
 Share of income from products other than rice 
 Proportion of expenditure for items not classified as basic necessities 
 Ownership of the selected household assets 
and decreases in: 
 Production costs for all crop types 
 Poverty incidence 
Since this kind of univariate analysis does not cover underlying relationships between 
variables, the analysis is extended using a binomial logit model.

III. REGRESSION ANALYSES 
The descriptive analyses presented in sections II and III of this paper point out significant 
differences between poor and non-poor households, which prompts research into the factors 
that determine the poverty status of households in 2003 given the endowments they had in 
2001. A logit model was estimated to answer this question. The explanatory variables in 
2003 were (Appendix 3): 
 Age and education of the household head 
 Household size 
 Place of residence 
 Poverty status in 2001 
 Farming area planted with rice 
 Cash crop area 
 Other crop area 
 Credit availed 
 Transportation asset ownership 
 Production asset ownership 
 Access to rural infrastructure 
 Main crop planted 
As outlined in the methodology section, a logit model is estimated where the probability of 
being non-poor is estimated by:

To test the fit of the model, the Hosmer and Lemeshow test was performed. The probability 
of 0.3972 suggests that the null hypothesis of the model being inadequate cannot be 
rejected. The 26 independent variables of the model also adequately explain the probability 
of households being poor or non-poor as evidenced by the likelihood ratio chi-squared. 
Thirty-two percent of the actual poor were classified falsely as non-poor while 28% of non-
poor were considered as poor in the model. Overall, the model correctly classified 69.74% of 
the sample into their actual poverty status in 2003 (Table 14). Details of the summary 
statistics and regression results are include in Appendix III (Tables A3.2 and A3.3.).

A. Interpretation of Results  
Age and Education of Household Head. It appears that age is not a very important 
determinant of poverty status in agrarian communities, possibly due to household heads? 
passing on tasks to younger members of the household. Living conditions and personal 
characteristics associated with poverty risks are often shared among members of the family. 
The less educated the household head, the lower the probability of being non-poor in 2003.  
ADBI Discussion Paper 110  Sununtar Setboonsarng 
16
Household Size. Consistent with most studies, the larger the family, the lower the chances 
of being non-poor. On average, predicted probabilities of households that were poor in 2001 
were 0.21 percentage points lower than those of the non-poor households. The rate of 
change in probabilities for those above the poverty line in 2001 peaked at six household 
members, then tapered off as household size increased. For those below the poverty line, 
the biggest decrease occurred at one to three household members, but, as the family size 
grew, the probability of being non-poor in 2003 decreased (Figure 9).

Place of Residence. Agricultural households in the ARMM have the lowest chance of being 
non-poor in 2003. Households from Visayas and Mindanao (excluding the ARMM) have very 
similar predicted probabilities while farmers in Luzon are significantly poorer. A possible 
explanation is that farmers in Luzon find it more difficult to earn high income due to the 
existence of natural calamities such as typhoons. Aside from being in mostly upland areas, 
the soil quality in Central Luzon is acidic due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and receives 
little assistance from the government. In contrast, farmlands in Mindanao are rarely plagued 
by typhoons, and local governments receive ample assistance from foreign donors and the 
government.

Poverty Status in 2001. Fifty-four percent of the sample was classified as poor in 2001. All 
else held at the mean, the predicted probability of being non-poor in 2003 was 0.59 when the 
household was non-poor in 2001. If the household income was below the poverty line in 
2001, the probability decreased to 0.33 (Figure 10).

Farming Area Planted with Rice The larger the area planted, the higher the probability of 
being non-poor. An additional hectare planted with rice increased the likelihood of being non-
poor by 0.23 points. All else held at the mean, a farmer who did not plant rice had 0.40 
predicted probability while a farmer who planted rice in 13 hectares had 90% chance of 
being non-poor in 2003. As expected, the larger amount of land tilled, the higher the 
probability of being non-poor. The gap in probabilities between the two groups also 
decreased as the planted area increased (Figure 11).

Cash Crop Area. Cash crops are composed of maize, sugar cane, and coconut. Of all 
crops, the cash crop group leads to the highest probability of being non-poor. For each 
additional hectare devoted to cash crops, the odds of being non-poor increased by a factor 
of 1.37, all else held constant (Figure 12).

Other Crop Area. This pertains to land area planted with crops other than rice, maize, sugar 
cane, and coconut. These crops are mostly fruits (especially bananas) and vegetables. A 
one-hectare increase in areas planted with other crops will increase the odds of being non-
poor by a factor of 1.27, roughly similar to rice areas (Figure 13).

Credit Availed. Although credit is not statistically significant, it is interesting to note that the 
higher the credit availed in 2001, the lower the probability of being non-poor in 2003. High 
credit amounts are particularly debilitating for households below the poverty line. A closer 
examination of the data shows poor households tend to obtain credit from informal sources 
(Figure 14).
Figure 14: Predicted Probability of Being Non-Poor and Credit 
Transportation Asset Ownership. While ownership of trucks and jeepneys does not 
significantly affect poverty incidence, ownership of tricycles increases the odds of being non-
poor by a factor of 1.48. The difference in predicted probabilities for tricycle and non-tricycle 
owners, however, is only 0.096 points. 
Production Asset Ownership. Ownership of generators, tractors, and threshers increases 
the likelihood of being non-poor by 35 points. Similar to transportation asset ownership, the 
difference between predicted probabilities among owners and non-owners is not very high. 
Non-owners are 43% likelier to be classified as non-poor while owners have a 50% 
likelihood. 
Access to Rural Infrastructure. Access to FMRs and bridges in 2001 increased the 
chances of being non-poor by 0.34 points. It appeared, however, that access to irrigation did 
not have that much effect on poverty incidence.  
Main Crop Planted. Coconut farmers are the most marginalized among all farmer groups. 
This is consistent with the findings of De Dios, 1993. Banana growers have the highest 
probability of being non-poor, followed by growers of other crops such as maize, rice, and 
sugar cane.

IV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE PROJECT AND 
IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE PROJECT DESIGN 
Among the different ARCP interventions, it appears that rural infrastructure?roads, in 
particular?has the strongest impact on poverty. Developing rural infrastructure has 
improved commodity transfer to markets and the inflow of production inputs to farms. 
Improved mobility of production inputs and outputs to and from farms has decreased the 
prices of inputs and increased income from agricultural produce. This finding is consistent 
with Balisacan?s 2001 contention that ?public investments in infrastructure, especially rural 
transport, generate economic linkages and externalities critical to sustained growth and 
development of the economy.? Balisacan et al. (2002) also assert: ?Road access can 
improve the well being of the poor provided they have sufficient human capital to take 
advantage of [such access]?. 
In contrast with a 9% increase in national poverty between 2001 and 2003, project 
interventions in the ARCP areas resulted in a 0.8% decline in poverty in the same period. 
After two years of project implementation, the average annual income in the ARCP areas 
increased by 12%. There were significant increases in ownership of assets (household and 
production), and there was better access to various services brought about by increases in 
transport assets and services. The findings suggest that there have been significantly 
positive changes in the socio-economic indicators in ARCP-area households. 
The economic activity that immediately benefited from the access infrastructure interventions 
is agriculture. Of all income sources, on-farm income increased most (39%). There was, 
however, limited non-farm employment generated by the project. In fact, the expansion of 
the agriculture sector fueled by the project appeared to have caused the shift from non-farm 
wage labor to farm labor, resulting in an overall decrease of 23% in total non-farm income. It 
is important to note that one employment opportunity for the poor, the manual carrying or 
hauling of agriculture products from farm to market, may have been replaced by the use of 
trucks or other means of mechanized transport once the rural roads were completed. 
Benefits derived from the positive effects of access infrastructure were, however, 
disproportionately captured by the non-poor over the poor households. The non-poor 
households have more land, own more production assets (7% more hand tractors and 3% 
more threshers than the poor), have better access to credit (non-poor credit access 
increased by 22%, while that of the poor declined by 12%), and are generally better 
educated than the poor households. Therefore, the non-poor were better equipped to take 
advantage of the project interventions. The findings showed that the non-poor households 
initially owned and acquired new transport assets during the two-year period. This allowed 
the non-poor to gain more income than the poor based on the opportunities brought about by 
the project. 
In contrast, the extreme poor may have lost some income-generation opportunities. This is 
supported by the findings on the changes in expenditures in which poor households fell 
below the bottom 60% income deciles and suffered decreases in expenditures. This is also 
consistent with the results of the Gini coefficient, which showed that income distribution 
deteriorated between the two periods. The poor benefited more, however, from the use of 
labor in the construction of the access infrastructure than the non-poor. 
In conclusion, this study on the initial impact of the ARCP access infrastructure on the well-
being of rural households confirms and reinforces the various yet similar assertions that 
public investments in infrastructure create opportunities in the rural areas and help reduce 
poverty as long as certain conditions are met. These conditions revolve around the capacity 
and capability of the rural households, particularly the poor, to take advantage of the benefits 
brought about by these investments. The results of the empirical examination show that 
while access infrastructure has led to improvements in the overall welfare of the rural 
households, non-poor households benefit more than their poor counterparts. Poor 
ADBI Discussion Paper 110  Sununtar Setboonsarng 
23
households, while on the whole benefiting from the improvements in access, tend to have 
lesser share in the benefits, with the poorest of the poor manifesting exclusion from the 
whole process. 
A. Recommendations 
The following recommendations are proposed: 
1. The project implementers and partners, particularly the local government units 
overseeing the project sites, should pay particular attention to the growing income 
disparity and the exclusion of the poorest of the poor from the development process 
since this may lead to social tensions; 
2. Institute necessary processes to allow the inclusion of all the poor in community 
consultations and also their participation in community organizations; 
3. Promote a regulatory environment for competitive transport services; 
4. Improve interventions in the provision of credit and development of microenterprises by 
supporting local microfinance institutions? extending their services in the ARC areas; 
5. Identify measures to minimize the interventions? negative impacts on the poor and 
women. 
B. Considerations in Future Projects 
The following are considerations for the design of future similar projects:  
1. The design and implementation of access infrastructure projects should include targeting 
project beneficiaries with special bias for the poorest of the poor; 
2. Operations and maintenance of access infrastructure should be integral to the project 
design and operations; infrastructure users?particularly the households who hold most 
of the benefits (i.e., transport operators)?should be required to bear a larger share of 
facility maintenance and upkeep; 
3. The packaging of access infrastructure projects should be accompanied by other support 
interventions that ensure the inclusion of the poor and help enhance their capacities and 
capabilities. Some of these interventions are: provision of credit, microenterprise 
development services, agricultural technology transfer, social capital formation, and 
gender integration. 
In project design and operations, measures that minimize the negative impacts of access 
infrastructure projects on the extreme poor and women should be integral even beyond the 
project?s construction duration. As transport infrastructure development often replaces the 
manual mode of transporting agriculture products with mechanized forms, attention should 
be paid to minimizing job displacement impact for the poor who work in hauling commodities. 
A development project may assist in identifying new employment opportunities for that 
particular group of poor wage laborers or providing a training program for them to work as 
mechanics in the transport sector.
