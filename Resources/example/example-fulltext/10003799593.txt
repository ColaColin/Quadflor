Abstract
In the last few decades, the e?ects of cooperative R&D arrangements on innovation and
welfare have played an important role in policy making. The goal of this paper is to analyze
the e?ects of cooperative R&D arrangements in a model with a stochastic R&D process and
output spillovers. Our main innovation is to allow for free entry in both the R&D race and
the product market. To determine the desirability of cooperation in R&D environments,
we compare three di?erent ways of organizing R&D activities: R&D competition, R&D
cartels, and RJV cartels. In contrast with the literature, we assume that cooperative R&D
arrangements do not have to include all of the firms in the industry. We show that shar-
ing of research outcomes is a necessary condition for the profitability of cooperative R&D
arrangements with free entry. The profitability of RJV cartels depends on their size. The
impact of cooperative R&D arrangements on the aggregate level of innovation depends on
whether there are participants in the R&D race who are a part of the cooperative R&D
arrangement. If some outsiders choose to participate in the R&D race, the aggregate rate of
innovation remains una?ected by the formation of a cooperative R&D arrangement. Oth-
erwise, it increases. R&D cartels may be welfare-improving in cases when they cause the
aggregate rate of innovation to increase. In such cases, it may be desirable to subsidize
them. Since sharing of R&D outcomes a?ects the equilibrium number of firms in the prod-
uct market after the R&D race, the consumer welfare e?ects of RJV cartels are sensitive
to the specification of consumer preferences. Subsidies may be desirable in cases of larger
RJVs since they are the ones which are less likely to be profitable.

1 Introduction
This paper analyzes the profit and welfare implications of cooperative R&D arrangements
in an uncertain R&D environment with free entry. In the last few decades, the obser-
vation that R&D environments are frequently characterized by substantial spillovers and
appropriability problems has resulted in a growing interest in the impact of cooperative
R&D arrangements on innovation and welfare.1 Despite the possible positive e?ects of
cooperative R&D arrangements on innovation and welfare, such arrangements pose a dif-
ficult problem for policy makers. This is because, as d?Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988)
noted nearly twenty years ago, they represent a hybrid of cooperative and non-cooperative
relations between firms. Nevertheless, the concern that competing firms in most R&D en-
vironments may have too little incentives to invest in R&D has caused both the US and
Europe to pass legislation for lenient antitrust treatment of research joint ventures (RJVs).2
A consistent feature of the literature exploring the e?ects of cooperative R&D arrange-
ments is the assumption that the number of firms participating in both the product market
and the R&D process is fixed.3 It is desirable to modify this assumption and study the
impact of free entry for a number of reasons. First, in many R&D intensive industries,
it may not be realistic to assume that only a limited number of firms can participate in
the R&D process.4 When firms cooperate, they a?ect the expected profits of their rivals
and, hence, may induce R&D race entry or exit. Second, after an R&D process, when the
1The discussion of the adverse e?ects of R&D spillovers and appropriability problems dates back to Arrow
(1962). Empirically, Mansfield et al. (1981) show that 60% of the patented innovations in their sample were
imitated within 4 years. Mansfield (1985) shows that information concerning development decisions leak out
to rival firms within about 12 to 18 months.
2 In the US, the National Cooperative Research and Production Act (NCRPA) of 1993 provides that
research and production joint ventures be subject to a ?rule of reason? analysis instead of a per se prohibition
in antitrust litigation. In the EU, the Commission Regulation (EC) No 2659/2000 (the EU Regulation)
provides for a block exemption from antitrust laws for RJVs, provided that they satisfy certain market share
restrictions and allow all joint venture participants to access the outcomes of the research.
3For the theoretical literature on research joint ventures, see, for example, Combs (1992), Kamien et
al. (1992), Motta (1992), Suzumara (1992), Choi (1993), Vonortas (1994), Ziss (1994), Poyago-Theotoky
(1995), Leahy and Neary (1997), Salant and Sha?er (1998), Martin (2002), Amir and Wooders (1999 and
2000), Amir (2000), Kamien and Zang (2000), Anbarci et al. (2002), and Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002), and
Hauenschild (2003). See De Bondt (1996) for an excellent survey.
4 In fact, in the closely related patent race literature, it is common to assume free entry into the R&D
process. See, for example, Loury (1979), Lee and Wilde (1980), Reinganum (1985), and Denicolo (2000).

research outcomes are available to a few firms only, their resulting competitive advantage
is likely to result in product market exit. However, as spillovers occur and the research
outcomes become available to more firms, this creates incentives for entry into the product
market.
Hence, allowing for entry into the R&D process and the product market introduces new
strategic, investment, and welfare implications of cooperative R&D. Two other important
assumptions which distinguish our model are the following. First, as in Miyagiwa and Ohno
(2002), we model R&D as a stochastic process. This assumption is in contrast with the
rest of the literature, where, following d?Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988), it is common
to model R&D as a deterministic process.5 Second, we assume that cooperative R&D
arrangements do not have to include all the firms in the industry. This is in accordance
with industrial practice, but contradicts the previous literature where it is generally assumed
that cooperative R&D arrangements involve all of the firms in the industry.6
In the model we consider, an R&D race is followed by oligopolistic product market
competition. The winner of the race has exclusive access to a quality-enhancing or cost-
reducing innovation for a limited period of time, after which the innovation spills over
to all of the firms in the industry. The duration of the exclusive access represents the
speed of outcome spillovers. It is a?ected by the e?ectiveness of patent and/or trade secret
protection.
Following the literature, we compare the following cooperative R&D arrangements with
the benchmark case of R&D competition, where firms choose their R&D intensities inde-
pendently. We first consider R&D cartels, where a fixed number of firms set their R&D
investment levels to maximize their joint profits, but do not share their research outcomes.
We show that with free entry, such cooperative arrangements are never profitable irrespec-
tive of the speed of spillovers. This result stands in stark contrast to the results in the
literature, where R&D cartels are always found to be profitable.
5 In addition to Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002), three other papers that model R&D as a risky activity are
Combs (1992), Choi (1993), Martin (2002), and Hauenschild (2003). Among these papers, our paper is
closest to Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) in terms of its approach and focus.
6Kamien and Zang (1993) is a notable exception.
2
We then consider RJV cartels, where a fixed number of firms choose their investment
levels to maximize their joint profits and share their research outcomes.7 We show that
such cooperative arrangements may be profitable depending on their size. Specifically, small
RJV cartels are more likely to be profitable and have higher per-firm investment levels than
R&D competition while large RJV cartels are more likely to be unprofitable and have lower
per-firm investment levels than R&D competition. This implies that sharing of research
outcomes is a necessary condition for the profitability of cooperative R&D arrangements
with free entry.
While RJV cartels are always profitable to form in papers where R&D is modelled as
a deterministic process, this is not necessarily the case in papers where R&D is modelled
as a stochastic process. Similar to our results, Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) and Choi (1993)
also qualify the conclusions of the deterministic R&D literature. Specifically, Miyagiwa and
Ohno (2002) show that with uncertain R&D, the profitability and welfare implications of
RJV cartels depend on the level of spillovers and the e?ect of sharing on industry profits.
Choi (1993) finds that RJV cartels may be unprofitable because he assumes that sharing
decreases product market payo?s. In comparison with these two papers, we show that when
markets are characterized by free entry, the key variable for RJV cartel performance is its
size. Hence, our findings can be used to explain why RJVs often do not include all of the
firms in an industry and why firms choose to conduct many R&D projects non-cooperatively.
Our analysis further reveals that the impact of cooperative R&D arrangements on the
aggregate level of innovation depends on whether there are participants in the R&D race
who are not a part of the cooperative R&D arrangement. If the size of the cartel is such
that some outsiders choose to participate in the R&D race, the aggregate rate of innovation
remains una?ected by the formation of a cooperative R&D arrangement. In such cases,
R&D cartels are still welfare-reducing because they are unprofitable. If the size of the
cartel is such that no outsider participants choose to participate in the R&D race, the
aggregate rate of innovation is higher with a cooperative R&D arrangement than without.
7Firms do not cooperate in the product market in either of these arrangements.
3
In such cases, R&D cartels may be welfare-improving because of their positive impact on
consumer welfare.
Whether there are outsider participants in the R&D race or not, the impact of RJV
cartels on consumer welfare depends on consumers? preferences. Although there are more
firms in the market with the new technology under an RJV cartel, since this causes more
firms with the old technology to exit, consumers also have access to less variety. RJV cartels
may be socially desirable depending on which e?ect dominates, which implies that antitrust
policy towards RJV cartels should be sensitive to consumers? preferences.
Hence, our results in general imply that there may be a case for subsidizing R&D cartels
without outsider participants in the R&D race and RJV cartels with or without outsider
participants in the R&D race because they may be unprofitable but welfare improving. This
conclusion is almost unique in the literature where, since R&D cartels are generally found
to be profitable, it is never necessary to subsidize them.8 RJV cartels are also found to
be more profitable than and welfare superior to R&D competition in the literature with
deterministic R&D and a fixed number of firms. Moreover, they are most profitable when
they include all of the firms in the industry.9 This contrasts with our results, which imply
that subsidies may be desirable precisely in cases of larger RJVs since they are the ones
which are less likely to be profitable. This result also di?ers from those in the literature
with stochastic R&D and a fixed number of firms, where the welfare implications of RJV
cartels depend on the level of spillovers.
The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present the details of the model. Section
3 presents the product market payo?s which we use in Sections 4, 5, and 6 in the analysis of
R&D competition, R&D cartels, and RJV cartels respectively. Section 7 explores the welfare
and policy implications of the cooperative R&D arrangements we consider. In Section 8,
we extend the analysis by considering the e?ects of cooperative R&D arrangements when
the cooperating firms face no competition from outsider participants in the R&D race in

to be redundant whether or not it is desirable.?

equilibrium. We conclude and make suggestions for future research in Section 9.
2 The Model
Consider a continuous-time model where initially symmetric firms compete both in a prod-
uct market and an R&D race for a new technology. There is free entry and exit in both the
product market and the R&D race. We assume that the product market is in a long-run
equilibrium when an opportunity for a new technology arises. Firms can compete either
individually or jointly to be the first to develop the new technology, which may be either a
quality-enhancing or a cost-reducing innovation.
We model research activity using a Poisson discovery process. Each firm operates an
independent research facility. We allow both incumbent firms and new firms to participate
in the R&D race. All participants must incur a one-time entry cost of S to enter the race.
The entry cost represents the race-specific fixed-cost expenditure. Firms share a common
discount rate r. Following Lee and Wilde (1980), we assume that the participants in the race
choose an R&D investment x and incur a flow cost x per unit of time. Investment provides
a stochastic time of success that is exponentially distributed with hazard rate h (x). We
assume that h0 (x) > 0, h00 (x) < 0, and h (0) = 0. lim
x?0
h0 (x) is su?ciently large to guarantee
an interior equilibrium and lim
x??
h0 (x) = 0.
Following the literature, we consider the following three scenarios. Under R&D com-
petition, the firms conduct research independently. They make their R&D and production
decisions to maximize their individual payo?s. With an R&D cartel, a set C = {1, ..., C}
of firms, which are exogenously designated to be part of the cartel, choose their R&D in-
vestments to maximize their joint profits. The cartel members do not share their research
outcomes and compete in the product market. With an RJV cartel, a set J = {1, ..., J}
of firms, which are exogenously designated to be part of the cartel, choose their R&D in-
vestments to maximize their joint profits and all participants in the cartel acquire the new
technology when and if one of the cartel?s members wins the race. After sharing the new
technology, the firms compete in the product market.
5
We let R = {1, ..., R} denote the set of all firms which choose to participate in the race.
In Sections 5 and 6, we first consider the case when R is strictly greater than the number
of firms which cooperate. In other words, we assume that some outsiders always find it
profitable to compete in the race. We later relax this assumption in Section 8.
The winner of the race has exclusive rights to the use of the new innovation for a duration
of T , after which time all firms immediately gain free access to the new technology. As stated
in Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002), T can be interpreted as the speed of outcome spillovers.
It is likely to be a?ected by the length and breadth of patent protection as well as the
technological ease of reverse engineering.
In the product market, we assume that all firms incur fixed costs of production as long
as they continue to produce. In other words, the fixed costs of production are an ongoing
expense, not a one-o? commitment. Payments on a renewable lease, utility fees, and head
o?ce costs are examples of these types of fixed cost.10
We make the following assumptions regarding the product market payo?s and use the
following notation. We let Nt stand for the number of firms active in the product market
at time t. Firms can choose to be active or inactive in the product market at every instant
in the game. During the race, there continues to be free entry into the product market. All
firms in the product market earn flow profits ?o (Nt) net of fixed costs of production, where
the superscript o stands for the old technology. However, firms do not need to be active in
the product market to be able to participate in the R&D race.
We let W stand for the number of winners at the end of the race. Hence, Nt?W stand
for the number of active firms with the old technology in the market. After the R&D race
ends but before the innovation spills over to the other firms in the industry, ?w (W,Nt ?W )
and ?f (W,Nt ?W ) denote the flow profits, net of fixed costs, earned by a firm with the
new technology and a firm with the old technology, respectively. Hence, if a single firm wins
the race, that firm earns ?w (1, Nt ? 1) while if an RJV cartel wins the race, each member
of the RJV cartel earns ?w (J,Nt ? J). We assume
10This can be seen as a long run approximation to an industry where some costs are sunk in the short
run.
6
Assumption 1 ?w (W,Nt ?W ) > ?f (W,Nt ?W ).
Hence, the firms with the new technology earn more than the firms with the old tech-
nology. Such an assumption holds in standard Cournot and di?erentiated good Bertrand
models. After T periods, the innovation spills over and the firms? flow profits become
?n (Nt) if they are active, where the superscript n stands for the new technology, and zero
otherwise.
We assume that all profit functions are decreasing in the level of competition, represented
in the following two assumptions by the number of firms with the new technology and the
total number of firms in the market, respectively.
Assumption 2 ?w (W,Nt ?W ) and ?f (W,Nt ?W ) are decreasing in W .
Assumption 3 All product market payo?s are decreasing in Nt.
To summarize, the timing of the game is as follows.
Stage 1: The product market is in a long-run equilibrium. An opportunity for the
development of a new technology arises.
Stage 2: The cooperative R&D structure is determined exogenously.
Stage 3: All firms, whether active in the product market or not, decide whether to incur
a fixed cost S to enter the R&D race. Those firms which are active in the product market
earn flow profits ?o (Nt).
Stage 4: The R&D race ends as soon as one of the firms develops the new technology.
After a firm wins the race but before spillovers occur, all firms with the new technology
earn a flow payo? of ?w (W,Nt ?W ) while all other active firms earn ?f (W,Nt ?W ) for
duration T .
Stage 5: After a duration of T , all firms gain access to the new technology and earn flow
payo?s of ?n (Nt) if they produce.
We solve for the subgame perfect equilibrium of this game using backward induction.
7
3 Product Market Competition
To determine the payo?s to the winners and losers of the R&D race, we start the analysis
by considering the product market competition after the race has ended. Note that the
equilibrium number of firms in the product market changes only when there is a change in
the technological environment. Hence, after the innovation spills over to all of the firms in
the industry, entry occurs until ?n (Nt) = 0 and the firms earn zero profits thereafter.
There is exit from the product market immediately after the race ends since the presence
of one or more firms with a better technology makes it unprofitable for (at least) some of the
firms that were in the market before the race came to an end to continue to produce. If the
innovation is not drastic, the remaining firms without access to the new technology continue
to produce using the old technology. Since exit happens instantaneously, the remaining firms
in the market immediately start to earn either ?w (W,Nt ?W ) or ?f (W,Nt ?W ). Hence,
after the R&D race ends but before spillovers take place, there are W firms in the market
with the new technology. Nt is equal to W if the innovation is drastic. If the innovation is
not drastic, the number of firms which are producing using the old technology is determined
by ?f (W,Nt ?W ) = 0.
4 R&D Competition
In this section we consider the benchmark case where the firms conduct R&D independently.
We show that there exists a free entry equilibrium to the R&D competition game, and
characterize the investment choices and the number of firms in this equilibrium.
With a Poisson discovery process, the probability that there has not been a discovery
until time t is given by exp
?

?
. Conditional on this probability, each participant
earns a flow profit of (?o (Nt)? xi) dt during the interval dt if they are active in the product
market and ?xidt otherwise. Since the product market is in a long-run equilibrium at the
beginning of the game and the decision to be active in the product market is independent
of the decision to be active in the R&D race, the number of firms in the market, Nt, does
not change until the race ends and is given by ?o (Nt) = 0.
8
If firm i innovates during the interval dt, its earnings for the period T are
TZ
0
e?rt?w (1, Nt ? 1) dt. (1)
As explained in Section 3, after the innovation arrives, Nt does not change until the end of
the period T . Hence, using NR to denote the equilibrium number of firms in the product
market during this time period, we can re-write (1) as
L

. (2)
If another firm innovates during the interval dt, firm i?s profit is equal to zero due to the
assumption of free entry and exit. Even after the spillovers occur and firm i gains access to
the new technology, since entry takes place until the product market profits are driven to
zero, firm i continues to make zero.
We can now write down the present discounted value of the sum of firm i?s expected
profits over time as

where ?i =

j 6=i
h (xj) stands for the aggregate hazard rate of the rival firms.
Given the memoryless nature of the Poisson process, firm i takes ?i as given and chooses
xi to maximize this payo? function at every point in time during the race. The first-order
condition is
h0 (xi)

The second-order condition is
h00 (xi)

< 0, (5)
which is always satisfied because of the concavity assumption on h (xi). Hence, the first-
order condition implicitly defines the optimal choice of xi as a function of the rival firms?
investment choices.
9
Since all of the firms are symmetric, we look for a symmetric equilibrium. The equi-
librium per-firm investment levels and number of firms can be determined by solving the
first-order condition of a generic firm and the zero profit condition simultaneously. To show
that there exists a free entry equilibrium, we need to show that the expected profits at the
beginning of the R&D race are decreasing in the number of firms.
For a profit-maximizing firm, we have
dVi
dR
=
?Vi
??i

?R
since ?Vi?xi = 0. The following lemma states how a profit maximizing firm?s payo? changes
with ?i.
Lemma 1 The expected payo? of a profit maximizing firm i that is active in the R&D race
decreases monotonically with the value of ?i.
Proof. Applying the envelope theorem to the maximum value of (3) gives
?
?
h (bx (?i)) Lr ? bx (?i)?
[r + h (bx (?i)) + ?i]2 < 0. (6)
To determine the sign of ??i?R , taking R as given, let x represent the symmetric solution
to the first-order conditions. It satisfies the following equation.
x = bx ((R? 1)h (x)) , (7)
where bx stands for the best response function. Note that at a symmetric equilibrium,
?i = ? = (R? 1)h (x). The corresponding per-firm profit level for a given value of R is
V (R) =
h (x) Lr ? x
r +Rh (x)
? S. (8)
We first analyze the slope of the best response function of firm i. Using the implicit
function theorem gives us
?bx (?i)
?xj
= ?
h0 (xj)
?
h0 (bx) Lr ? 1?
h00 (bx) ?L+ bx+ Lr ?i? . (9)
10
Note that the first-order condition given in (4) can be re-written as

h0 (xi)
L
r
? 1
?
[r + h (xi) + ?i]? h0 (xi)
?
h (xi)
L
r
? xi
?
= 0. (10)
From (3), we have ?i + S =
[h0(xi)Lr ?1]
h0(xi) . Hence, we can re-write (9) as
?bx (?i)
?xj
= ?h
0 (xj)h0 (bx) (?i + S)
h00 (bx) ?L+ bx+ Lr ?i? , (11)
which is > 0 since h00 (xi) < 0. Hence, the investment choices of the firms are strategic
complements.
We next show that x is increasing in R. Using (7) we get
?x
?R
=
?bx ((R? 1)h (x))
?R
=
??x
?(R?1)h(x)h (x)
1? ??x?(R?1)h(x) (R? 1)h0 (x)
. (12)
The numerator of this expression is positive because the investment decisions of the firms
are strategic complements. Following Lee and Wilde (1980), we define the expression in the
denominator as a stability condition. Hence, it is also positive and ?x?R > 0. This implies
??
?R > 0 and we can now state the following result.
Proposition 1 There exists a free entry equilibrium to the R&D competition game where
the equilibrium number of firms, R?, is determined by V ? = V (R?) = 0. Each of these R?
firms invests x? = x (R?).
5 R&D Cartel
In this section, we compare the case of R&D competition with the case where a group of C
firms form an R&D cartel. The cartel members participate in the R&D race by choosing
their investment levels to maximize their joint payo?s, but they do not share their research
outcomes. Hence, as in the case of R&D competition, each firm i in the cartel earns Lr only
in the case when it wins the race. We assume that due to free entry in the R&D race, the
cartel participants still face competition from outsider participants in the race.

outsider participants in the race. Each outsider maximizes the payo? function given in (3).

participant invests xO, and RC stands for the number of participants in the R&D race.

The following proposition establishes that there exists a free entry equilibrium with an
R&D cartel. As in the case of R&D competition, the result relies on a stability condition
specified in the Appendix.
Proposition 2 There exists a free entry equilibrium with an R&D cartel.
Proof. See Section 1 in the Appendix.
11 It is straightforward to verify that the second-order conditions hold because of the concavity assumption
on h (xi).
12
To determine the profitability of R&D cartels and their impact on innovation, we start
by comparing the per-firm investment level under R&D competition with the per-firm in-
vestment level in an R&D race with an R&D cartel. The following proposition establishes
that while the cartel participants reduce their per-firm investment level, the outsider par-
ticipants invest the same amount as they do under R&D competition.
Proposition 3 In equilibrium, the per-firm investment level of the R&D cartel participants,
xC, is lower than the per-firm investment level under R&D competition, x?. The investment
level of outsider firms in the R&D race with an R&D cartel, xO, is equal to x?.
Proof. See Section 2 in the Appendix.
With free entry in the product market, R&D investments always confer a net negative
externality on rivals. Outcome spillovers do not provide any benefit to the firms that lose
the R&D race because any future rents that could be earned by using the new technology
are dissipated through entry into the product market. This transforms the R&D race into a
winner-takes-all game. Since the R&D cartel members internalize the negative externality
they impose on each other, they invest less than the outsider participants in the race.
In the proof of Proposition 3, we use Lemma 1 to show that all outsider firms invest the
same amount in the presence of an R&D cartel as they do under R&D competition. Since
in both cases the outsider firms earn zero profits in equilibrium, Lemma 1 implies that they
face the same profit maximization problem and choose the same solution.
Comparing these results with those of Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) reveals the importance
of the assumption of free entry. If there are barriers to entry in the product market, the
losers of the R&D race still get a chance to benefit from the innovation after spillovers
happen. For su?ciently small values of T (i.e., for su?ciently rapid spillovers), this positive
spillover e?ect outweighs the negative competitive e?ect mentioned above and, thus, R&D
investments confer a net positive externality on the rival firms. Hence, Miyagiwa and Ohno
(2002) find that for su?ciently small T values, when firms form an R&D cartel that allows
them to internalize these positive externalities, they end up increasing their investment
13
levels above the investment level under R&D competition.12
Ultimately, what is important is the impact of the R&D cartel on the aggregate arrival
rate of innovation. The conclusion in the literature is that R&D cartels decrease the ag-
gregate rate of innovation for su?ciently low spillovers and increase it for su?ciently high
spillovers. This follows immediately from the per-firm investment results discussed above
since it is generally assumed that all firms participate in the R&D cartel. In our context,
due to the assumption of free entry, one cannot readily use the results on the changes in
the individual investment levels to determine the impact of R&D cartels on the aggregate
rate of innovation. Instead, we proceed in the following way. Since there are outsider firms
in the R&D race, the aggregate arrival rate of innovation is equal to h (xi) + ?i from the
perspective of any outsider firm i. Since the outsider firms earn zero profits both with an
R&D cartel and under R&D competition, Lemma 1 implies that ?i is the same in both
cases. From Proposition 3 we know that xi = x? in both cases also. Hence, the aggregate
rate of innovation is the same in both cases. This implies that the total number of firms
participating in the R&D race must be higher with an R&D cartel than under R&D com-
petition. That is, since xC < xO and xO = x?, more firms must be investing with an R&D
cartel to achieve the same level of aggregate innovation as under R&D competition.
The following proposition summarizes this discussion.
Proposition 4 In an R&D environment with an R&D cartel,
(i) the aggregate arrival rate of innovation is the same as under R&D competition;
(ii) a higher number of firms participate in the R&D race than under R&D competition.
With a fixed number of participants in the R&D race, the formation of an R&D cartel
would cause the outsider firms? expected profits to increase because the R&D cartel members
invest less than they do under R&D competition. With free entry into the R&D race,
the increase in the expected profits of the outsider firms invites entry into the race until
12This result is in line with the results of the other papers in the literature that model R&D as a deter-
ministic process. If the rate of spillovers is su?ciently high, the positive externality they generate outweighs
the negative externality generated by competition. See, for example, d?Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988)
and Kamien et al. (1992).
14
the expected profits are driven down to zero. Proposition 4 implies that the entrants?
investment level exactly compensates for the decrease in the investment level of the R&D
cartel members.
We finally evaluate the profitability of R&D cartels.
Proposition 5 All R&D cartels are unprofitable.
Proof. Each member of the R&D cartel and each outsider firm face RC ? 1 competitors
in equilibrium. Of these, RC ? 2 competitors are the same for these two type of firms.
However, an R&D cartel member?s RC ? 1th competitor is an outsider firm investing x?
while the outsider firm?s RC ? 1th competitor is an R&D cartel member investing xC < x?.
Hence, the value of ?i faced by a member of the R&D cartel is higher than the value of ?i
faced by an outsider. By Lemma 1, this implies that the outsider firm would earn a higher
profit than the R&D cartel member if both firms maximized their individual profits. The
R&D cartel member earns even less since it does not maximize its individual profits.
This result also contrasts with the results in the previous studies of R&D cartels, which
consistently find that the joint profits of the firms within an R&D cartel are higher than
their joint profits under R&D competition.13 In our analysis, free entry into the R&D
race makes otherwise profitable R&D cartels unprofitable. This is because the members of
an R&D cartel earn less than the outsider participants in the race because of a free rider
e?ect.14 The outsider firms benefit from the lower investment of the cartel members because
it increases their probability of success. Since the outsiders earn zero and the R&D cartel
members earn less, the R&D cartels are unprofitable in equilibrium.15
13Again, see, for example, d?Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988), Kamien et al. (1992), and Miyagiwa and
Ohno (2002).
14A similar kind of free rider e?ect exists in the mergers literature. See Salant et al. (1983) and Deneckere
and Davidson (1985).
15Erkal and Piccinin (2006) and Davidson and Mukherjee (2007) show that free entry in the product
market makes otherwise profitable product market mergers unprofitable.

6 RJV Cartel
We next consider the case where an exogenously-determined group of J firms participate
in the R&D race by forming an RJV cartel. The firms make their R&D decisions jointly
and gain immediate access to the new technology in the event that any one of them wins
the race.

, depends on
the number of participants in the RJV cartel because the winner shares the new technology
with the rest of the cartel, which determines the number of firms in the product market

We start the analysis by establishing that, as in the case of R&D competition and
R&D cartels, there exists a free entry equilibrium with an RJV cartel where each cartel
member invests xJ , each outsider participant invests xO, and RJ stands for the number
of participants in the R&D race. In equilibrium, these values must satisfy the first-order

As in the case of R&D competition and R&D cartels, the result relies on a stability condition
specified in the Appendix.
Proposition 6 There exists a free entry equilibrium with an RJV cartel.
Proof. See Section 3 in the Appendix.
The di?erence between an RJV cartel and an R&D cartel is the product market payo?
the members receive when one of the cartel participants wins the R&D race. Hence, to
determine the profitability of RJV cartels and their impact on innovation, we first explore
how the equilibrium per-firm investment and profit levels of an RJV cartel change with LJ .
While analyzing the impact of an increase in LJ , one has to take into account its e?ect on
the entry and investment decisions of the outsider participants in the R&D race also. We
have the following result.
Lemma 2 The equilibrium per-firm investment and profit levels of an RJV cartel of size J
are monotonically increasing in LJ .
Proof. See Section 4 in the Appendix.
We next evaluate the performance of an RJV cartel for low and high values of LJ to be
able to draw conclusions for the range of possible RJV cartel e?ects. The following lemma
presents results for the cases when LJ = LJ and L
J = L.
Lemma 3 If LJ = LJ , in equilibrium the members of the RJV cartel invest less than x
?,
the per firm investment level under R&D competition, and make a lower profit than they
would under R&D competition. If LJ = L, in equilibrium the members of the RJV cartel
invest more than x? and make a higher profit than they would under R&D competition.
16 It is straightforward to verify that the second-order conditions hold because of the concavity assumption
on h (xi).
17
Proof. See Section 5 in the Appendix.
In the comparison of the per-firm investment levels in an environment with an RJV cartel
and in an environment with R&D competition, two e?ects play a role. First, while firms
inflict negative externalities on each other under R&D competition, members of RJV cartels
confer positive externalities on each other because they share their research outcomes. Joint
profit maximization allows the cartel participants to internalize these positive externalities,
which causes the per-firm investment level to increase. Second, the per-firm returns to
winning when the firms are part of an RJV cartel di?er from those under R&D competition
because when a member of the RJV cartel wins the R&D race, all its members have access
to the new technology. When LJ = LJ , the returns with an RJV cartel are lower than the
returns under R&D competition, which are equal to L. This a?ects the per-firm investment
level with an RJV cartel adversely. Lemma 3 implies that when LJ = LJ , this negative
e?ect dominates the positive e?ect and, hence, the members of the RJV cartel invest less
than they would under R&D competition and make lower profits. On the other hand, when
LJ = L, the returns to winning are the same under both arrangements and the first e?ect
causes the per-firm investment and profit level to be higher with an RJV cartel.
In papers which model R&D as a deterministic process, RJV cartels are always profitable
and result in an increase in the level of investment because of spillovers and joint-profit
maximization. In contrast, in papers which model R&D as a stochastic process, RJV
cartels may not always be profitable. Choi (1993) finds that RJV cartels may be unprofitable
because in his model sharing of R&D outcomes increases product market competition. Such
an assumption is not required for our results. Indeed, in our framework, it is possible for
sharing of R&D outcomes to increase industry profits since it can also reduce the total
number of participants in the product market.17 RJV cartels may be unprofitable even
in those cases when sharing increases industry profits because of free entry in the R&D
race. In contrast, Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) find that if industry profits increase with the
sharing a new technology, the members of a RJV cartel must be making higher profits than
17Note that even though we allow for outsiders and entry, industry profits are still equal to the total profits
made by the cartel members since the outsiders make zero profits.
18
they would under R&D competition.
As far as RJV cartels and R&D cartels are concerned, we point out in the proof of Lemma
3 that when LJ = LJ , an RJV cartel and an R&D cartel of the same size would result in the
same level of per-firm investment and would earn the same profits in equilibrium. Together
with Lemma 2 this implies that for LJ > LJ , firms make higher investments and higher
profits in an RJV cartel than in an R&D cartel.
Using Lemmas 2 and 3, we can establish the existence of two critical values, bLJ (J)
and eLJ (J), such that the per-firm profit and investment levels will be higher with an
RJV cartel than under R&D competition if LJ > bLJ (J) and LJ > eLJ (J) respectively.
Establishing that bLJ (J) < eLJ (J), the following proposition presents a characterization of
the performance of R&D environments with RJV cartels based on LJ .
Proposition 7 For values of J such that LJ > eLJ (J) ? ?bLJ (J) , L?, the members of
an RJV cartel invest higher amounts and make higher profits than they would under R&D
competition. For values of J such that LJ ?
hbLJ (J) , eLJ (J)i, the members of an RJV cartel
invest lower amounts and make higher profits than they would under R&D competition. For
values of J such that LJ < bLJ (J) ? ?LJ , L?, the members of an RJV cartel invest lower
amounts and make lower profits than they would under R&D competition.
Proof. See Section 6 in the Appendix.
Proposition 7 implies that if the per-firm investment level is higher with an RJV cartel,
it must be the case that the per-firm profit level is also higher. The reason that the firms
may be making higher profits even if their investment levels are lower than they would be
if they were not cooperating is that they benefit from each other?s investment levels. Being
a member of the RJV cartel provides them with insurance in that they start to earn LJ as
soon as any member of the cartel successfully develops the new technology. Hence, with
lower individual investment amounts, they can still have higher individual expected payo?
levels than they would under R&D competition.
Proposition 7 allows us to link RJV cartel size to RJV cartel performance if we impose
a weak condition on the relationship between LJ and J .
19
Assumption 4 ?L
J (J)
?J 6 0 and limJ??L
J (J) < 0.
Assumption 4 states that the returns from winning the R&D race are weakly decreasing
in the size of the RJV cartel. This assumption would be satisfied in many standard models
of oligopolistic competition with free entry. In the next example, we illustrate this with the
specific case of homogeneous good Cournot competition. Additional examples can be given
using models of logit and CES demand systems.18
Example 1 Let inverse demand be given by P (Q) = 100 ? Q. Suppose the firms with
the new technology has a marginal cost of zero and the firms with the old technology face
MC = 1. The fixed cost of production is 9 for all firms.
For given levels of N and J, total quantity produced is
Q =
100J + (N ? J) 99
(N + 1)
.
Since the firms producing with the old technology make

?

in a free entry equilibrium. Note that N > J for J 6 9. Hence, for J 6 9, each cartel
member makes ?
N + 100? J
(N + 1)
?2
? 9 = 91
and LJ = L. In a model with entry and exit, for J 6 9, an increase in J has two opposing
e?ects on the the product market profits of the cartel members. While having more rivals
which have access to the new technology puts more competitive pressure on the cartel mem-
bers, it also causes more of the firms which do not have access to the new technology to exit.
The above result implies that these two e?ects exactly balance each other.
For su?ciently large values of J, i.e., for J > 9, no firm finds it profitable to partici-
pate in the market using the old technology. Hence, each cartel member?s profit, given by?
100
(J+1)
?2
? 9, strictly decreases with J.
Given Assumption 4, the following corollary follows immediately from Proposition 7.
18More generally, it can be shown that Assumption 4 would be satisfied in any model of Bertrand com-
petition with a separable indirect utility function or Cournot competition with a separable direct utility
function.
20
Corollary 1 The members of a su?ciently small RJV cartel invest higher amounts and
make higher profits than they would under R&D competition. The members of an intermediate-
sized RJV cartel invest lower amounts and make higher profits than they would under R&D
competition. The members of a su?ciently large RJV cartel invest lower amounts and make
lower profits than they would under R&D competition.
The per-firm payo? to winning the R&D race, LJ , depends on the RJV cartel?s size, J .
For su?ciently large RJV cartels such that LJ < bLJ (J), these payo?s are lower because
the innovation is shared amongst more firms in the product market, which increases the
product market competition. Corollary 1 compares RJV cartels of various size categories
with the benchmark of R&D competition. It provides an explanation for why relatively
small RJV cartels may form - these may be more profitable than larger ones. Indeed, some
large RJV cartels may be unprofitable because they include too many firms.
This analysis makes an important contribution to the literature since studies of coop-
erative arrangements in R&D environments generally assume that all of the firms in the
industry participate in the cooperative structure. Hence, they do not analyze the impact of
RJV cartel size on performance. An exception is Kamien and Zang (1993). Using a model
with barriers to entry and a deterministic R&D process, they find that if the firms in an
industry form competing RJV cartels, the resulting investment level may be higher than if
all of the firms were members of the same grand RJV cartel. However, firms always make
higher profits with a grand RJV than with competing RJVs. In contrast, we find that
smaller RJV cartels may be more profitable than larger RJV cartels. The di?erence is due
to entry. In Kamien and Zang (1993), profits are higher with a larger RJV because the
cartel members face less competition during the R&D process. In our case, having a larger
RJV does not necessarily result in less competition in the R&D process because of the free
entry and exit of outsider firms. Smaller RJVs may be more profitable because although
the benefits from joint profit maximization are lower with a smaller RJV, each firm expects
to earn a higher amount in the product market.
Finally, we turn our attention to the impact of RJV cartels on the aggregate arrival
21
rate of innovation. Since the analysis is identical to the analysis in the case of R&D cartels,
which precedes Proposition 4, we do not repeat it here. We get the following result.
Proposition 8 The aggregate arrival rate of innovation with an RJV cartel is the same as
under R&D competition.
This result di?ers from the results in the literature with barriers to entry. In the deter-
ministic R&D literature, RJV cartels always increase the aggregate arrival rate of innova-
tion. In contrast, Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) show that with a stochastic R&D process, the
impact of RJV cartels on the aggregate arrival rate of innovation depends on the level of
spillovers and the e?ect of sharing on industry profits. Our results extend those of Miyagiwa
and Ohno (2002) by pointing out that with free entry, even if the per-firm investment level
is di?erent from the R&D competition level, the aggregate arrival rate of innovation remains
the same.
7 Welfare and Policy Implications
We next turn our attention to the welfare and policy implications of the cooperative R&D
arrangements that we have considered. We define welfare as the sum of consumer welfare
and producer surplus. This implies that since the firms make zero profits in equilibrium,
welfare under R&D competition is equal to
W ? =

stands for the consumer welfare level after the race ends and one firm has the new technology
for duration T . ?o, ?1 and ?n stand for the flow consumer welfare when no firms, only one
firm, and all firms have access to the new technology, respectively.
Similarly, the equilibrium welfare expressions with an R&D and RJV cartel are

1? e?rT
?
?J + e?rT?n
r
(26)
stands for the consumer welfare level after the race ends and J firms have the new technology
for duration T .
These expressions show that since we evaluate welfare from an ex ante perspective, the
aggregate arrival rate of innovation determines how rapidly consumers start to benefit from
the new technology and firms start to make profits from it. Although Propositions 4 and 8
state that the aggregate rate of innovation remains unchanged with R&D and RJV cartels,
we show in the following discussion that their formation may still a?ect welfare adversely.
7.1 R&D Cartels
Since the innovation arrives at the same time in expectation whether or not there is an
R&D cartel, we have
WC ?W ? =
C
?
h
?
xC
? L
r ? xC
?
r + Ch (xC) + (RC ? C)h (x?) ? C ? S. (27)
That is, the only di?erence between the welfare level with an R&D cartel and the welfare
level under R&D competition is the expected profits of the R&D cartel members themselves.
This is because in both cases there is only one firm with the new technology in the market
for the duration T after the R&D race ends. This implies that consumer welfare is the same
in expectation whether an R&D cartel is formed or not.
Since we know from Proposition 5 that R&D cartels earn negative profits, (27) implies
that they must be welfare decreasing. Hence, our analysis implies that in industries with
free entry, R&D cartels would never arise and antitrust policy towards them is irrelevant.
Moreover, since they always decrease welfare, it is not desirable to subsidize R&D cartels
23
in order to make them profitable if there are outsider participants in the R&D race. We
show in Section 8 that this conclusion may change if no outsiders choose to participate in
the R&D race.

(28)
That is, the di?erence between consumer welfare with an RJV cartel and under R&D
competition is that when an RJV cartel wins the race but before spillovers occur, there are
J firms with the new technology rather than only one. Hence, from (23) and (26) we can
conclude that any profitable RJV cartel is also welfare improving if ?J > ?1. While one
may expect consumer welfare to be increasing in the number of firms with access to the new
technology, this may not always be the case with free entry and exit because increasing the
number of firms with the new technology causes greater exit of firms with the old technology.
Therefore, there may be fewer firms active in the product market when an RJV cartel wins
the race than when a single firm does. In general, the net e?ect on consumer welfare of an
RJV cartel can go either way depending on consumers? preferences and, hence, profitable
RJV cartels may present a welfare trade-o? between lower expected consumer welfare and
higher expected profits.
This analysis implies that in industries with free entry, antitrust policy should pay care-
ful attention to consumers? preferences and may, therefore, di?er between industries. This
contrasts with the policy prescriptions in the literature with barriers to entry and deter-
ministic R&D, where RJV cartels are always found to be welfare improving and, therefore,
should be allowed. Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) reach a more cautious conclusion. They find
that it is both privately and socially optimal to form an RJV cartel if spillovers are fast
and industry profits from sharing exceed those without sharing.19 In our model, however,
19 In all other circumstances, they cannot guarantee that the private and social incentives to cooperate
24
these two conditions together are neither necessary nor su?cient for the social and private
incentives for RJV cartels to coincide.
The analysis also implies that there may be a case for subsiding unprofitable RJV
cartels when they are welfare improving. This conclusion is a major departure from the
results in the literature with deterministic R&D and barriers to entry, where Leahy and
Neary (1997) conclude, for instance, that ?policy intervention to encourage cooperation
is likely to be redundant whether or not it is desirable.? In the case of uncertain R&D,
Choi (1993) and Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) do find room for subsidizing RJV cartels. In
particular, Choi (1993) concludes that the social incentives to form RJVs always exceed
the private incentives. However, Choi?s (1993) results depend upon the assumption that
sharing results increases product market competition. Such an assumption is not necessary
for our conclusions, which are driven by the extra pressure put on members of cooperative
arrangements by entrants. Although Miyagiwa and Ohno (2002) state that ?there is no
guarantee that the R&D regime that the industry selects is the best for society,? they do
not identify when, if at all, government support would be desirable (p. 868). Our analysis
takes us a step closer to this, with the surprising result that subsidies may be desirable in
case of larger RJVs. Of course, not all such RJV cartels are welfare improving, but small
RJV cartels where the members invest more per-firm than they do under R&D competition
should not require support.
8 Cooperative R&D without R&D race outsiders
In the analysis above, we have maintained the assumption that some outsiders always
find it profitable to enter the R&D race in equilibrium. In this section, we provide some
additional insights about cooperative R&D arrangements with free entry for the case where
no outsiders choose to enter the race. We do this to address the potential concern that
cooperation between firms in the R&D race may induce the exit of outsiders and, thus,
reduce competition in the R&D race. Our results in this section show that the prospect of
will coincide.
25
cooperative R&D having this e?ect is no cause for concern.
The main di?erence in results from the case with outsiders concerns the aggregate rate
of innovation. Surprisingly, we show in the following proposition that without outsiders,
the aggregate rate of innovation with either an R&D or an RJV cartel must be at least as
high as it is under R&D competition. This is because if outsiders find it unprofitable to
enter the race, it must be because the cooperating firms have collectively invested enough
to ensure any entry would be unprofitable.
Proposition 9 If there are no outsiders in equilibrium, the aggregate rate of innovation
with an R&D cartel or an RJV cartel must be at least as high as it is under R&D competition.
Proof. We present the proof for the case of an R&D cartel only since the case of an RJV
cartel is identical. Suppose not. That is, suppose there are no outsiders in the R&D race
in equilibrium and the aggregate rate of innovation with an R&D cartel is lower than that
under R&D competition. We know that firms make zero profits under R&D competition
due to free entry. By Lemma 1, this implies that a profit-maximizing marginal entrant must
be making a positive profit with an R&D cartel. Hence, it cannot be the case that there
are no outsiders participating in the R&D race in equilibrium.
We show in Section 7 of the Appendix that most of the other results from the previous
analysis continue to hold without R&D race outsiders. In particular, we show that all
R&D cartels are unprofitable and their per-firm investment is less than x?. Moreover, there
are critical values of LJ above which RJV cartels invest more per-firm than x? and are
profitable.
The only policy conclusion that is qualitatively di?erent from those we reached in Section
7 is that it may be desirable to subsidize those R&D cartels which increase the aggregate
rate of innovation since they increase consumer welfare in expectation. Hence, R&D cartels
without R&D race outsiders may present a welfare trade-o? between lower profits and
higher consumer welfare. To the best of our knowledge, the conclusion that subsidies for
R&D cartels may be socially desirable is unique in the literature since they are always found
to be profitable.

9 Conclusion
We have analyzed the e?ects of cooperative R&D in a model of free entry with stochastic
R&D and an oligopolistic product market. Our findings account for the e?ects of entry and
exit in R&D environments which have been missing from the literature to date. In contrast
with the results in the literature, we have shown that R&D cartels are always unprofitable
and never a?ect the aggregate rate of innovation adversely in equilibrium. RJV cartels, on
the other hand, can be profitable depending on their size. Similar to R&D cartels, they also
never adversely a?ect the aggregate rate of innovation.
Both the standard approach of modelling cooperative R&D with barriers to entry and
our approach of free entry can be understood as opposite ends of a spectrum. This paper
o?ers some guidance as to how the existing literature?s policy prescriptions may change as
entry conditions vary along this continuum. Our results indicate that it may be desirable
to subsidize R&D cartels in cases when there are no outsider participants in the R&D race.
Such a policy conclusion does not find support in the existing literature which assumes
barriers to entry because a consistent conclusion of this literature is that R&D cartels
are always profitable. The results also imply that since sharing of R&D outcomes a?ects
the equilibrium number of firms in the product market after the R&D race, the consumer
welfare e?ects of RJV cartels are sensitive to the specification of consumers? preferences.
Hence, the optimal antitrust treatment of cooperative R&D arrangements may be di?erent
for di?erent industries and a detailed analysis of demand may be required to determine the
appropriate policy approach. Subsidies may be desirable in cases of larger RJVs since they
are the ones which are less likely to be profitable.
Future research should consider the e?ects of input spillovers on cooperative research
with free entry. The assumption of a Poisson discovery process used in this paper may not
be appropriate for such a study because of the assumption that the research paths embarked
upon by firms are independent. If one firm?s research project benefits from the e?orts of a
rival firm, it would seem more reasonable to assume that their instantaneous probabilities
of success should be correlated.

1 Proof of Proposition 2
Let xC and xO stand for the investment levels which satisfy the first-order conditions of
the cartel participants and the outsider firms, respectively, for a given number of cartel
participants, C, and outsiders, O = R ? C. We first show that, as in the case of R&D
competition, xC and xO are both increasing in R by invoking a stability condition.
For given values of C and R, let GC and HC represent the first-order conditions given
in (14) and (15). GC and HC implicitly define xC and xO. Totally di?erentiating and

denotes the number of participants in the R&D race and all outsider participants earn zero
profits.
2 Proof of Proposition 3
The first step is to show that xC < xO. Consider the first derivatives for the cartel?s and a
typical outsider?s optimization problems. After imposing symmetry, these are given by

< 0. (A.8)
Hence, whenever eGC ? eHC = 0, which must be the case in equilibrium, we must have
xC < xO.
We next show that xO = x?, which implies that if there are any active outsiders in the
R&D race, each member of the R&D cartel invests xC < x?. To see this, note that all
active outsider firms in the R&D race earn zero profits in equilibrium. Hence, by Lemma 1,
an outsider firm i must face the same value of ?i as it does under R&D competition. This
implies that it solves the same maximization problem as it does under R&D competition
and invests x? whether or not there is an R&D cartel participating in the R&D race also.
32
3 Proof of Proposition 6
Let xJ and xO stand for the investment levels which satisfy (19) and (20), respectively, for
a given number of cartel participants, J , and outsiders, O = R ? J . We start by showing
that xJ and xO are both increasing in R by invoking a stability condition analogous to the
one in the proof of Proposition 2.
For given values of J and R, let GJ and HJ represent the first-order conditions given in
(19) and (20). GJ and HJ implicitly define xJ and xO. Totally di?erentiating and applying
Cramer?s Rule gives

The first term on the right hand side is positive and the first part of the second term is
negative by inspection of (17). From Lemma 1 we know that in a free entry equilibrium,
the outsiders must face the same value of ?i regardless of the value of LJ . This implies that
dRJ
dLJ < 0 since x
O = x? and dx
J
dLJ > 0, as established above. Hence, the second part of the
second term is negative also.
5 Proof of Lemma 3
Substituting for LJ = LJ in the first derivative of (13) with respect to xi reveals that if
C = J , i.e., if an R&D cartel and an RJV cartel both have the same number of firms,
the per-firm investment level is the same under both types of cooperative arrangements.
Similarly, substituting for LJ = LJ in the equilibrium payo? level shows that the profits
are also the same under the two types of cooperative arrangements. Hence, the results for
34
LJ = LJ follow from Proposition 3 and Proposition 5.
Consider now the case where LJ = L. The first step is to show that xJ > xO. Consider
the first derivatives for the cartel?s and a typical outsider?s optimization problems. After
imposing symmetry, these are given by

Hence, whenever eGJ ? eHJ = 0, which must be the case in equilibrium, we must have
xJ > xO.
We next show that any active outsider participant in the R&D race must invest x?.
All active outsider firms in the R&D race earn zero profits in equilibrium. By Lemma
1, this implies that an outsider firm i must face the same value of ?i as it does under
R&D competition. Hence, it solves the same maximization problem as it does under R&D
competition and invests x?. This result together with the analysis above implies that if
there are any active outsider participants in the R&D race, each member of the RJV cartel
invests xJ > x? in equilibrium.
To see that the RJV cartel earns positive profits, note that if we hold the outsiders?
investments constant at x? and decrease the RJV cartel?s investment to x?, the RJV cartel?s
35
per firm profits are
h (x?) JLr ? x?
r + Jh (x?) + (RJ ? J)h (x?) ? S (A.19)
and an outsider firm earns
h (x?) Lr ? x?
r + Jh (x?) + (RJ ? J)h (x?) ? S, (A.20)
which is clearly less. However, the outsider firm would be earning strictly positive profits,
since there would be fewer firms in total making the same per-firm investments as under
R&D competition. Hence, the RJV cartel would also be making strictly positive profits.
Since the RJV cartel chooses xJ to maximize its joint profits given the outside firms choose
x?, it must earn even higher profits in equilibrium.
6 Proof of Proposition 7
We know from Lemma 3 that when LJ = LJ , the members of the RJV earn less than they
would under R&D competition, and when LJ = L, they earn more than they would under
R&D competition. Hence, given Lemma 2, there must exist a critical value bLJ ? ?LJ , L?
above which the profits with an RJV cartel of size J are higher than they are under R&D
competition and below which they are lower.
Similarly, we know from Lemma 3 that when LJ = LJ , the members of the RJV invest
less than they would under R&D competition and when LJ = L, they invest more than
they would under R&D competition. Hence, given Lemma 2, there must exist a critical
value eLJ ? ?LJ , L? above which the per-firm investment level with an RJV cartel of size J
is higher than it is under R&D competition and below which it is lower.
To prove that eLJ > bLJ , we evaluate the profitability of an RJV cartel when LJ = eLJ and
show that it is positive. When LJ = eLJ , the RJV cartel?s equilibrium per-firm investment
is x? by definition. Note that each outsider participant in the R&D race in equilibrium
earns
h (x?) Lr ? x?
r + Jh (x?) + (RJ ? J)h (x?) ? S = 0 (A.21)
36
while each member of the RJV cartel earns
h (x?) J ?L
J
r ? x?
r + Jh (x?) + (RJ ? J)h (x?) ? S. (A.22)
Subtracting (A.21) from (A.22) yields
h (x?)
h
J ?LJ?L
r
i
r + Jh (x?) + (RJ ? J)h (x?) > 0 (A.23)
since eLJ > L.
7 Cooperative R&D without R&D race outsiders
In this section, we show to what extent the results stated in Propositions 3, 5, and 7 extend
to the case where no outsiders find it profitable to enter the R&D race.
Proposition 10 When there are no active outsider firms in the R&D race in equilibrium,
the per-firm investment level with an R&D cartel is lower than the per-firm investment level
under R&D competition. However, R&D cartels are always unprofitable.
Proof. We first show that xC < x? in equilibrium. When there are outsider participants
in the R&D race, we know from Proposition 3 that xC < xO = x? and from Proposition
4 that R?h (x?) = Oh (x?) + Ch
?
xC
?
, where R?h (x?) is the equilibrium aggregate rate of
innovation under R&D competition andO is the equilibrium number of outsider participants
in the R&D race in the presence of an R&D cartel. Hence, as O ? 0 from above, it must
be the case that C > R?. Let bC stand for the value of C such that Ch ?xC? = R?h (x?).
We have xC
? bC? < x?.
For C > bC, there are no outsider participants in the R&D race. The first-order condition
of the R&D cartel reduces to
h0
?
xC
? ?
L+ CxC
?
?
?
r + Ch
?
xC
??
= 0. (A.24)
Using the implicit function theorem we have
?xC
?C
= ?
h0
?
xC
?
xC ? h
?
xC
?
h00 (xC) [L+CxC ]
. (A.25)
37
The denominator is clearly negative because h
?
xC
?
is concave. The numerator is equal to
zero at xC = 0 and is strictly decreasing in xC for all xC > 0. Hence, ?x
C
?C < 0 for all C > bC
and we can conclude that xC < x? when there are no active outsiders in the R&D race.
To show that R&D cartels are unprofitable when there are no outsider participants in
the R&D race, note first that we know from Proposition 5 that as C approaches bC from
below, the per-firm profit level of the R&D cartel members is negative. For all C > bC, we
can use (13) to write the equilibrium per-firm R&D cartel payo? as
V C =
h
?
xC
? L
r ? xC
r + Ch (xC)
? S. (A.26)
Applying the envelope theorem, we have ?V
C
?C < 0. Hence, CV
C < 0 for all values of C such
that there are no outsiders in equilibrium.
Proposition 11 When there are no active outsider firms in the R&D race in equilibrium,
members of an RJV cartel invest higher (lower) amounts per-firm than they do under R&D
competition for values of J such that LJ > eLJ (J) ? ?LJ , L? (LJ < eLJ (J) ? ?LJ , L?).
Members of an RJV cartel earn higher (lower) profits than they do under R&D competition
for values of J such that LJ > bLJ (J) ? ?LJ , L? (LJ < bLJ (J) ? ?LJ , L?).
Proof. First, note that when there are no outsiders in the R&D race, we have
?xJ
?LJ
= ?
Jh0
?
xJ
?
Jh00 (xJ) [LJ + xJ ]
> 0 (A.27)
and
d
?
JV J
?
dLJ
> 0. (A.28)
Hence, the per-firm investment level and the joint profits of an RJV cartel are monotonically
increasing in LJ .
To get the result stated in the proposition, we next show that when LJ = LJ , R&D
cartels invest less than x? per firm and are unprofitable, and when LJ = L, R&D cartels
invest more than x? per firm and are profitable.
When LJ = LJ , the first-order condition and equilibrium profit function of an RJV cartel
are identical to those of an R&D cartel of the same size. We know from Proposition 10 that
38
R&D cartels invest less than x? per firm and are unprofitable. Hence, the same must be
true of RJV cartels when LJ = LJ .
When LJ = L, if there are outsider participants in the R&D race, we know from Lemma
3 that xJ > x? and from Proposition 8 that R?h (x?) = Oh (x?)+Jh
?
xJ
?
. Hence, as O? 0
from above, it must be the case that J < R?. Holding LJ fixed at L, let bJ stand for the
value of J such that Jh
?
xJ
?
= R?h (x?). We have xJ
? bJ? > x?.
For J > bJ , there are no outsider participants in the R&D race. The first-order condition
of the RJV cartel reduces to
Jh0
?
xJ
? ?
L+ xJ
?
?
?
r + Jh
?
xJ
??
= 0. (A.29)
Using the implicit function theorem we have
?xJ
?J
= ?
h0
?
xJ
? ?
L+ xJ
?
? h
?
xJ
?
Jh00 (xJ) [L+ xJ ]
. (A.30)
The denominator is clearly negative. Since the first-order condition implies that the numer-
ator is equal to rJ > 0, we have
?xJ
?J > 0. Hence, we can conclude that x
J > x? when there
are no active R&D race outsiders.
To show that the members of an RJV cartel earn more than they do under R&D com-
petition, note first that we know from Lemma 3 that as J approaches bJ from below, profits
are higher with an RJV cartel. When there are no outsiders in the R&D race, each cartel
member?s payo? is
V J =
h
?
xJ
? JL
r ? xJ
r + Jh (xJ)
? S. (A.31)
Applying the envelope theorem gives
?V J
?J
=
rh
?
xJ
? L
r + h
?
xJ
?
xJ
[r + Jh (xJ)]2
> 0. (A.32)
Hence, JV J < 0 for all values of J such that there are no outsiders in equilibrium.
