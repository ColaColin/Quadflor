The price of modern maritime piracy 
 
Inmaculada Martínez-Zarzoso*, Sami Bensassi**, 
 
Abstract  
A growing body of literature has recently focused on the economic origins and consequences of 
modern maritime piracy and on the perception that the international community has failed to 
control it. This paper aims to investigate maritime transport costs as one of the channels through 
which modern maritime piracy could have a major impact on the global economy. A transport-
cost equation is estimated using a newly released dataset on maritime transport cost from the 
OECD together with data on maritime piracy from the IMB. Our results show that maritime 
piracy significantly increases trade cost between Europe and Asia.

1- Introduction 
 
There is growing evidence showing that maritime piracy increases maritime transport cost for a 
number of reasons. First, in 2008 some ship-owners have made clear their intention to re-route 
some of their lines to avoid dangerous waters. Second, the Gulf of Aden was added by Lloyds in 
its list of warzones in May 2008 based on the claim of insurers and sailors to demand a premium 
when a vessel navigates this region. Finally, firms providing security services or devices on 
board are burgeoning as a consequence of piracy 1. Those are probably the main channels 
through which freight rates are impacted by maritime piracy. However, the lack of systematic 
data on insurance contracts2, salaries paid by ship-owners, the proportion of ships re-routed, the 
investment in defense measures and poor data on freight rates made difficult to implement any 
comprehensive study of the impact of piracy on transport cost. This is an important caveat given 
that in a world of decreasing trade barriers related to custom duties and tariffs; transport cost 
have become one of the main obstacles to international trade (Hummels, 2001).  
As piracy acts occurs mainly on the Euro-Asia maritime trade route, higher freight rates may 
hinder trade between these two continents. Increasing transport prices might also reinforce the 
idea, put forward by the shipping industry, to develop a north trade route between Europe and 
                                                            
1 The most important shipping companies, CMA-CGM, MSC and Maersk have announced in 2009 they would 
divert some of their lines through the Cape route (Times 2008, Port Strategy 2009). The Indian shipping association 
has declared that depending upon the size, war risk premium for merchant vessels sailing in Indian Ocean has gone 
up from $500 per ship and per voyage to up to $150,000 per ship and per voyage (Financial Express, 2011). 
Shipping companies as Interoient Line Services have considered hiring private security service companies costing 
US$60000 per trip (Miller, 2008).

owners do not have to insure themselves against the risk of war.

Asia passing through the Artic region. This development could have heavy consequences in 
terms of environmental costs and on the economies currently benefiting from their position on 
the current route between Europe and Asia as Egypt or Singapore.  
This paper aims to fulfill some of the abovementioned gaps in the literature by testing the effect 
of modern maritime piracy on maritime trade cost. We propose a simple model of transport cost 
determination and derive a transport costs equation augmented with maritime piracy as an 
additional explanatory variable. To our knowledge, this is the first study that focuses on unitary 
transport costs as response variable. We overcome the major hurdle of data availability by using 
a new database on maritime transport cost developed by the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and data on modern maritime piracy obtained from the 
International Maritime Bureau (IMB). The sectoral information provided in the maritime 
transport cost database allows us to test whether pirates attack more ships transporting certain 
type of goods3. 
Our findings show a significant and positive impact of maritime piracy on maritime transport 
cost. One additional ship hijacked results in 1.2% increase in maritime transport costs between 
Europe and Asia. These results maybe of importance for policy makers interested in the relative 
position of Euro-Asian trade compared to USA-Asian trade. In particular, we show that localized 
conflicts could harm selectively some international trade routes.  
This paper is organized as follow: Section 2 reviews the literature on maritime piracy and 
transport cost. Section 3 describes the data and presents some descriptive statistics. Section 4

outlines the model specification and empirical estimation and section 5 presents the main results. 
Concluding remarks are presented in section 6. 
2- MARITIME PIRACY AND TRANSPORT COST 
Our paper brings together two different strands of the economic literature: whereas the first one 
analyzes the economic aspects of modern maritime piracy, the second focuses on the 
determinants of international transport cost. 
2.1 Modern maritime piracy and international trade 
A number of international trade economists have modeled the impact of adverse conditions, such 
as insecurity, conflicts and terrorism, on international trade (Anderson and Marcouiller, 2002 and 
2005; Mirza and Verdier, 2008). Maritime piracy has also been specifically linked to trade. In 
particular, Bendal (2010) and Fu et al (2010) focus on the economic impact of maritime piracy 
on trade through the decision of ship operators to change their main trade routes between Europe 
and Asia in order to avoid Somali piracy. Moreover, Bensassi and Martinez-Zarzoso (2011) 
evaluate the impact of maritime piracy on the volume of trade between European and Asiatic 
countries. In this line of study we aim to extend this research by analyzing the effect of maritime 
piracy on the price of maritime transport.  
We also contribute to the ongoing debate in the scientific community on the motivations and the 
methods used by pirates. Some scholars sustain that pirates are not choosing their prey according 
to the shipment transported by the vessel (Mejia and al, 2009), but tend to avoid attacking ships 
flying the colors of countries having military presence in their close vicinity (Kiourktsoglou and 
Coutroubis, 2010). Another view supported by Hastings (2009) is that pirates choose their targets 
5 
 
according to the value on the black market of the shipment transported. He indicates that Somali 
and Malaccan pirates show a different behavior. Whereas Somali pirates are mostly interested in 
the expected ransom they will receive for the ship and the crew, Malaccan pirates are mostly 
interested in selling back rapidly their loots. The main reason for the latter behavior is the 
pressure put by the authorities around them and the possibilities that a particular region offers to 
sell back the lootings done. However, the fact that the Malaccan pirates care about the shipments 
of the vessels they attack does not mean that they will systematically prey on the same sort of 
merchandises. Our paper gives some support to the first argument, namely pirates are not 
concern with the type of good transported, by showing that at least within broadly defined goods 
categories this is not the case.  
2.2 The determinants of transport cost 
For many years international trade economists have been using the iceberg transport cost4 
formulation as an analytical devise that greatly simplify trade analysis. However, the explicit 
iceberg assumption is not observational or empirical. Indeed, in reality transport cost per tone is 
not invariant with respect to the tonnage of material deliver. In applied work, distance has been 
used for many years in gravity models of trade as a proxy for transport costs, assuming that 
transport cost is an increasing function of distance between the trading countries. However 
distance remains an unsatisfactory measure of trade cost because it is time unvaried and 
independent of the tonnage of transported goods. It has been only in the last two decades that 
more sophisticated ways have been used to measure transport cost and to analyze its impact on 
international trade. In the early 2000, Limao and Venables (2001) and Micco and Perez (2001) 
                                                            
4 According to the iceberg transport cost assumption, part of the goods to be delivered are consumed by the very act 
of transporting. 
6 
 
added infrastructure variables to gravity equations to better characterize the impact of transport 
costs on trade. A second wave of research emphasized that transport costs is indeed 
endogenously determined (Martinez Zarzoso and Suarez Burguet, 2005; Martinez Zarzoso and 
Wilsmeier, 2007; Korinek and Sourdin, 2009ab). Transport cost may be endogenous for a 
number of reasons, such as the presence of economies of scale in transports or the existence of 
trade imbalances that causes the price of transport to differ according to the direction of trade. 
For example, Martinez Zarzoso and Suarez Burguet (2005) estimate a simultaneous system of 
equations of transport costs and trade where both variables are considered as endogenous. 
Similarly, Martinez Zarzoso and Wilmsmeier (2007) propose a transport costs model in which 
trade is endogenous and trade imbalances are an important determinant of transport cost. We 
specify a similar model in which modern maritime piracy is introduced as an additional variable 
that determines international maritime transport costs.  
Finally, it is worth mentioning that it is outside the scope of the paper to investigate the channels 
through which piracy affects transport costs using statistical methods. As mentioned in the 
introduction we only found anecdotal evidence showing that sailors’ salaries and insurance cost 
have increased as a consequence of maritime piracy. Indeed we did not find comprehensive data 
on neither insurance premia nor sailors’ salaries. In addition, differences between the various 
types of insurances across countries made difficult any comparison. For example a federal 
program, the U.S Maritime War Risk Insurance Program covers for the additional risk of 
maritime piracy directed against U.S vessels (Ploch et al. 2010) 
Concerning the use of the Cape Route it is particularly difficult to have a clear evaluation of the 
number of ships being effectively re-routed. It is hard to believe that the re-routing of the ships 
through the Cape may be a safe solution for most of the maritime commercial traffic as the 
7 
 
activities of Somali pirates expanded to the north of Madagascar and Mauritius Island (see 
Figure 1). Finally, shipping companies are particularly secretive when it comes to the measures 
they used to defend their ships. For neither of these variables, we find satisfying proxies to be 
used in our study. 
3 MARITIME PIRACY AND TRANSPORT COSTS: THE CURRENT 
SITUATION 
3.1 Geography of maritime trade and piracy 
The surfacing of maritime piracy depends on the existence of advantageous geographical 
conditions, namely  narrow straits to spot future preys, islets or coastal areas remote enough to 
escape any form of authorities (Murphy, 2008; Ong-Webb, 2007). Not only geographical 
conditions are important, but also the geo-economic and political context of the countries 
suitably located to host piracy. Maritime piracy could indeed take roots when intensively used 
maritime trade routes pass in the vicinity of potential pirates’ harbors located in failed or weak 
states. Nowadays, the two main maritime piracy hot spots, the Malacca straits and the Gulf of 
Aden, show these favorable conditions. The Malaccan piracy was more intense in the late 
nineties; whereas Somali piracy plays today the leading role. These two hot spots of maritime 
piracy are located on the trade routes linking Asia to Europe. 
In order to examine the extent of the problem posed by piracy to shipping between Europe and 
Asia, we rely on a similar strategy as in Bensassi and Martinez-Zarzoso (2011), but we focus on 
the price of transport as the response variable instead of focusing on trade volumes. We have 
divided the oceans between the two continents into five regions: the European Seas (ES) from 
the coastal areas of Iceland and Norway in the North to the waters of the Canary Islands in the 
8 
 
South, in addition to the Mediterranean and Black Seas; the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden (RSGA) 
which includes a vast area of the Indian Ocean along the shores of Oman, Somalia and Tanzania; 
the Indian Sub-Continental Seas (ISCS) along the shores of Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Ceylon 
and the Maldives; the South-East-Asian Seas (SEAS) comprising the waters of Indonesia and the 
Philippines, as well as those of Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia; and the 
East-Asian Seas (EAS) which encompasses the Yellow Sea between China and Korea, the East 
and South China Seas, and the Japanese coasts . 
Figure 1. Maritime Regions 
A ship heading from a port in northern Europe to China must cross all five maritime regions; 
four if it ends its journey in Singapore and three if it unloads its shipment in Mumbai (see Table 
A.1 in the Appendix). The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) Live Piracy Report, offers 
information on the number of incidents of piracy occurring annually in each of the five regions 
between 1999 and 2007, as well as the number of incidents on three different routes linking 
Europe and Asia over this 9 years period (see Graph A.1 & A2 in the Appendix).  
We are mostly interested in the Euro-Asia route because very few piracy incidents occur on the 
main shipping lines connecting other large economic areas. A way to investigate graphically the 
impact of piracy on transport cost is to compare the evolution of transport cost in the Europe-
Asia route with the evolution in other regions without piracy. In this way we are able to compare 
with the counterfactual of almost no-piracy incidents. In Figure 2 we show the evolution of 
maritime transport costs between two trade routes: the USA-EU15 trade route and the China-
EU15 trade route. Only the second route has been plagued with a high level of piracy. The figure 
indicates that the freight rates for container transport show a different evolution for each trade 
9 
 
route. Whereas transport costs show a clear decreasing trend for the USA-EU15 trade, for the 
China-EU15 the numbers decrease only slightly over the whole period and show spikes in 1999 
and 2004. The occurrence of these peeks could be due to maritime piracy, but market conditions 
may have played also an important role. In our paper, we show that piracy has a “positive” 
impact on maritime trade cost once the impact of the size of the trading countries, the trade 
imbalance between these countries, their volume trade and other unobservable time-variant 
factors common to all routes are taken into account.   
Figure 2. Evolution of average transport freight rates for two alternative routes 
We differentiate between three kinds of incidents according to the extent to which the ship’s 
journey is disrupted: Attempted acts of piracy, boarding acts and hijackings. An attempted piracy 
act occurs when pirates board a ship and abandon it empty-handed after being discovered, or in 
instances in which a ship is fired upon without being stopped. Instances of boarding entail actual 
boarding of a ship by pirates and theft (generally the personal belongings of the crew and/or 
goods carried for crew maintenance and en-route ship repairs). These incidents may involve 
violence against the crew. The last type of piracy act, hijacking, consists in the seizure of the ship 
and its crew, the immobilization of the ship in a coastal area under the control of the pirates and a 
ransom being demanded in exchange for the crew members, the ship and its cargo. It is most 
obviously hijackings that are the most disruptive for maritime trade. Figure 3 shows the 
evolution of the three types of piracy incidents over time between Europe and East Asia.

3.2 MEASUREMENT OF TRANSPORT COSTS 
10 
 
One of the main difficulties in analyzing transport costs is that of obtaining reliable data. In the 
recent economic literature there have been several attempts to measure directly or indirectly 
transport costs. Some authors used cif/fob ratios as a proxy for shipping costs (Baier and 
Bergstrand, 2001, Limao and Venables, 2001; Radelet and Sachs, 1998). Since most importing 
countries report trade flows inclusive of freight and insurance (cif) and exporting countries report 
trade flows exclusive of freight and insurance (fob), transport costs can be calculated as the 
difference of both flows for the same aggregate trade. However, Hummels (1999b) showed that 
importer cif/fob ratios constructed from IMF sources are poor proxies for cross-sectional 
variation in transport costs and such variable provides no information about changes in transport 
costs over time. Oguledo and Mcphee (1994) also doubted the usefulness of cif/fob ratios from 
IMF sources as a proxy of transportation costs.  
Several authors have attempted to construct more accurate measures of transport costs. Hummels 
(1999a, 1999b) use data on transport costs from various primary sources including shipping price 
indices obtained from shipping trade journals (Appendix 2 in Hummels, 1999b); and freight rates 
(freight expenditures on imports) collected by customs agencies in United States, New Zealand 
and five Latin-American countries (Mercosur plus Chile). In addition to cif/fob ratios reported by 
the IMF, Limao and Venables (2001) use shipping company quotes for the cost of transporting a 
standard container (40 feet) from Baltimore to sixty-four destinations. The authors pointed out 
that it is not clear how the experience of Baltimore can be generalized. Martínez-Zarzoso et al. 
(2003) used data on transportation costs obtained from interviews with logistic operators in 
Spain. Micco and Perez (2001) used data from the U.S Import Waterborne Databank (U.S. 
Department of Transportation), where transport cost is defined as "the aggregate cost of all 
freight, insurance and other charges (excluding U.S. import duties) incurred in bringing the 
11 
 
merchandise from the port of exportation to the first port of entry in the U.S.". Sanchez, 
Hoffmann and Micco (2002) analysed data on maritime transport costs obtained from the 
International Transport Data Base (BTI). They focused on Latin American trade with NAFTA. 
In this paper, we use a newly released database from the OECD which overcomes some of the 
problems presented by the precedent databases. This database contains maritime trade for 20 
importing countries and 218 exporting countries for the period 1991 to 2007, covering different 
categories of products. The data come from several reliable sources (original customs data from 
Australia, New Zealand and the United States and also private sources as Containerization 
International, Drewry Consulting and the Baltic Dry Shipping Index). A sound methodology is 
used to harmonize these various sets of observations (Korinek, 2008). The advantages of this 
database in terms of comprehensiveness and time span make it a valuable tool for the study of 
transport costs (Korinek and Sourdin, 2009a; Korinek and Sourdin 2009b). Figure 4 displays the 
evolution of the average unit transport cost for four categories of goods (manufactured goods, 
dirty bulk, crude oil and agricultural goods) exported from Europe (EU15) to Asia.

4 FACTORS EXPLAINING TRANSPORT COSTS 
4.1 Model specification 
A general formulation of transport costs for commodity k shipped between countries i and j, in a 
given period of time, can be written as: 
TCijkt = F(Xit, Xjt, vijt, ωk, μij, φt)      (1) 
12 
 
where Xit and Xjt are country specific characteristics, vijt is a vector of characteristics related to 
the journey between i and j, ωk is a product specific effect that captures differences in transport 
demand elasticity across goods, μij represents unobservable heterogeneity that is specific to each 
trading flow and φt unobservable heterogeneity that is time-specific. 
GDP and population of the trading countries are used to proxy for country specific 
characteristics, such as infrastructure and quality of institutions5. The vector vijt includes the trade 
imbalance between countries i and j, a proxy for economies of scale proxies with the volume 
traded between countries i and j, and our variable of interest, namely the number of piracy 
incidents involving hijacking along the trade route linking country i and j. Distance between i 
and j and other variables related to each bilateral trade relationship could be added to model μij 
but we have preferred to specify bilateral fixed effects μij in order to capture all the time-
invariant unobserved heterogeneity attached to each pair of trading countries. Product specific 
dummy variables are used to account for ωk and time specific dummy variables (φt) are added as 
a proxy for unobserved variables that influence transport costs and are time variant but common 
for all trading pairs, as for example technological improvements in transport.  
Assuming a multiplicative form, a transport cost function is specified as: 
  
where TCijkt denotes unitary maritime transport cost for each 2-digit HS product category, i 
denotes the importer country, j denotes the exporter country and t the year, k is the 2-digit level 
of the HS classification. Y denotes the GPD of the corresponding country, Pop denotes 
                                                            
5 We also used alternative variables, namely road infrastructure and a liner shipping connectivity index as proxies 
for infrastructure. The results concerning our target variable were unchanged and are available upon request from 
the authors.

population. Imb is the trade imbalance between country i and j calculated as the difference 
between exports from i to j and imports of i from j in absolute value. XM denotes trade volumes 
in tons calculated as the sum of exports and imports, Hijackrt denotes the number of piracy 
incidents involving hijacking along the trade route r in year t linking country i and j. Other type 
of piracy incidents (boarded ships and attempted attacks) will also be considered as explanatory 
variables. μij, ωk and φt denote the different sets of fixed effects described above. Finally, εijkt is 
the error term that is assumed to be identically and independently distributed.  
Taking natural logarithms of equation (2) we obtain a linear version of the general specification 
given by, 
 
where ln denotes natural logarithms and all the variables have been described after equation (2). 
4.2 Data and variables 
In this section we describe the data and variables used in our empirical work. Sources and 
variable definitions are listed in Table A.2. The dependent variable (TC) is obtained from the 
OECD data base on maritime transport costs. We use the maritime transport costs between the 
European Union and 13 destinations in Asia6 for each HS 2 digits class of goods. We 
differentiate four types of goods: manufactured goods, raw materials, agricultural goods and 
crude oil. The target variable is t_hijack that stands for the number of hijacked ships on a 
                                                            
6 For the European Union, the maritime transport cost database considers the EU15 as a single emitter of data. Data 
for Bulgaria, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland and Slovenia are also 
available.  The Asiatic countries in our dataset are Bangladesh, China, Indonesia, India, Japan, South Korea, 
Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Australia was added to this group.

particular route. Each pair of country is associated with one trade route. We expect t_hijack to 
correlate positively with maritime transport costs. Other variables that measure piracy incidents 
are: t_boarded, the number of incidents in which a ship has been boarded but not hijacked; and 
t_attempted, the number of attempted attacks that do not succeed. These two variables will also 
be used in the empirical analysis as additional explanatory variables.  
Additional explanatory variables are: GDP (Yit ; Yjt), population (Popit ; Popjt), trade imbalances 
(Imbijt) and trade volumes (XMijt). The source for the three first variables is the world 
development indicators dataset (WDI) from the World Bank. GDP and population of the 
importer and exporter countries are used as control variables for country characteristics. The 
trade imbalance is expected to be negatively correlated with bilateral maritime transport cost if 
bidirectional transport costs between two regions are jointly determined, since transport costs 
will depend on the relative demand for transports between regions (Jonkeren, Demirel Ommeren 
and Rietveld, 2010). Finally the trade volume is expected to have a reducing effect on transport 
prices, since routes characterized by intense trade may foster competition and reduce 
transportation costs, this variable has been obtained from Eurostat. Summary statistics of the 
described variables are presented in Table 1. 
Table 1. Summary statistics 
An alternative variable that could be used instead of piracy events is The Lloyd’s classification 
of a war zone. In Table A.3 we show the evolution of the different zones reported through the 
last 6 reports of Joint War Committee available on line. We would like to underline that for most 
of the observations, when a country is listed the war zone concerns the limits of the national 
waters of this country. This definition, pertinent and useful when a war occurred and the 
15 
 
insurance companies require a strict defined geographical perimeter, seems to us limitative in 
order to grasp the piracy phenomena. With the only exception of thieves in ports, the pirates’ 
attacks occur en route. It is true that most of these attacks take place not far from a coastal area 
but nonetheless pirates do not feel bound by the territorial limits defined internationally 
(particularly in the zones were several national maritime zone are in contact or very close as in 
the Gulf of Aden or the Strait of Malacca). The joint war committee has tackled this problem by 
defining broader zone of danger (Gulf of Aden, Sulu Archipelago). In this instance, the Gulf of 
Aden zone juxtaposes quasi perfectly with the Red Sea Gulf of Aden maritime zone defined in 
our paper. Even if similar zones are defined the war zone classification presents the important 
disadvantages of not revealing any information on the intensity of the conflict and of presenting 
very few variations over time. By providing a count of the number of incidents over time for 
each geographic zone and trade route defined, the IMB database, in our sense, was more suitable 
for the type of study we aimed to do. 
5 Empirical application and main results 
5.1 Main results 
Equation (3) has been estimated using a least squares dummy variable estimator (LSDV) with 
different sets of dummies to control for unobservable heterogeneity. To test whether piracy acts 
have different impacts on transport costs depending on the nature of transported goods, we 
estimate Equation (3) for four different types of goods (agriculture, manufactures, raw materials 
and crude oil) and for two different types of transport (containers and tankers and dirty bulk). 
Tow type of piracy, namely number of hijacked ships and number of boarded ships enter the 
16 
 
trade cost equation significantly7. The baseline estimation results are shown in Table 2 (LSDV 
estimates). In Table 3, we estimate Equation (3) with the variables t_hijack and t_boarded lagged 
two years8. In doing so, we control for the possibility that shipping contracts are agreed upon in 
advance. The estimated coefficients for the different sets of fixed effects (k, ij, t) are not shown9. 
Both Tables report the results assuming common coefficients for all types of products in the first 
column and specific estimates for four different types of goods, namely manufactures, 
agricultural goods, raw materials and crude oil in columns 2, 3, 4 and 5, respectively.  
[Table 2,3] 
In both estimations (LSDV and LSDV with lagged piracy variables) the piracy coefficients have 
the expected positive signs and are statistically significant at conventional levels for total trade, 
manufactures and agricultural products. The coefficients in Table 3 are slightly higher for 
t_hijack for total trade, manufactures and agricultural products and turn out to be also positive 
and significant for raw materials and crude oil. One additional hijacked ship results in an 
increase of around 1.6 percent (Table 3, column 1) of maritime transport costs between Europe 
and Asia. A positive and significant effect is also found for manufactures and agricultural goods 
considered separately in both specifications and for raw materials and crude oil only using 
lagged values of piracy incidents. One additional act of hijacking results in an increase of around 
1.5 percent and 1.4 percent of maritime transport costs for manufactured goods and agricultural 
goods respectively. When considering boarded ships as piracy acts, the impact on transport costs 
                                                            
7 Attempted attacks was also originally considered but it was not statistically significant and it is not included in the 
final estimations.

period are available upon request.

is lower but also shows a positive and statistically significant effect for all categories of goods in 
Table 2 and for the two main categories (agricultural and manufacturing products) in Table 3. 
According to our data, the unit maritime transport cost of footwear was 0.505 US$ in 2007 that 
for a shipment of 10000 units of footwear between Europe and Asia amounts to 5050 US$. One 
more act of hijacking translates into an increase of 75.75 US$ for the shipment. Furthermore, if 
we also consider the number of piracy acts resulting in the successful boarding of a ship, the 
increase in transport costs will be of 96 US$. The coefficient on the variable t_boarded is not 
statistically significant for raw materials and for crude oil when used lagged values (Table 3, 
columns 4 and 5). However for these two categories of goods the number of observations 
available is very low in comparison with manufactures and agricultural products. This is 
probably the reason why the results are less robust to changes in the specification.  
5.2 Robustness check 
We mentioned that there is a certain level of controversy in the scientific community concerning 
the fact that pirates may choose the ships they attacked according to the good transported. Since 
transport costs depend on the nature of transported goods, the piracy variable in Equation (3) 
might be endogenous. As a robustness check we estimate Equation (3) for ships transporting 
containers on one side and for tankers and ships transporting dirty bulk on the other side. Tankers 
are one of the main categories of ships under attack according to the ICC database (see Table 
A.4). However, it seems that very few attacks on this kind of vessels are successful and result in 
hijacking. Among the 30 attacks on oil tankers in 2008 only one has been successful10. Among 
the observations in our dataset, crude oil is transported by tanker but also by dirty bulks ships. 
                                                            
10 The successful attack of the Sirius Star a new launch Saudi Arabian super tanker made the top of the news for 
several weeks during 2008. It has been ever since the biggest ship captured by Somali pirates.

Therefore we have aggregated these two categories.  The results are shown in Table 4 and 
indicate that the impact of piracy is greater for tankers and ships transporting dirty bulk. 
We tried also several sets of instruments and finally instrumented the number of vessels hijacked 
with the number of hijacks in the three previous years. The model is estimated using a 
Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) that is robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation 
of unknown form. We also tried with ship boarding and boarding attempts as instruments, but the 
variables are correlated with the number of vessels hijacked and are not independent of the type 
of transported goods and thus correlated with the error term in our transport cost equation.   
The results of the IV estimation when a GMM approach is taken are reported in Table 5 for all 
goods (colum 1) for manufactures (column 2) and for agriculture (column 3).  We were not able 
to find valid instruments for crude oil and raw materials. Our variable of interest stays positive 
and significant and the magnitude is similar to the one obtained in Table 3. It is worth noting that 
although widely use in the empirical literature, the use of internal instrument may not the best 
strategy. We leave this issue for further research.

6 CONCLUSION 
In this paper we quantify the impact of maritime modern piracy on maritime transport cost of 
trade between European Union countries and Asian countries. The main results indicate that the 
effect is substantial and significant. Piracy increases maritime trade cost between Europe and 
Asia by a non negligible amount.  
19 
 
The presence of failed or weak states along the main maritime trade route between Europe and 
Asia harm selectively the trade between the two continents. In a context where it has been 
demonstrated that small downward variation in trade barriers could allow the entrance of smaller 
firms on international markets (Melitz, 2003; Chaney, 2008), the disadvantage of higher 
transport cost between Europe and Asia harms the interest of Europe in comparison to its 
competitors on the expanding markets of Asia. 
In addition, the increase of transport costs due to maritime piracy could lead to some shipping 
companies to exploit the Artic route between Europe and Asia passing along the coasts of 
Russia. The route has been free of ice for at least three years from the end of August to the 
beginning of October. Without the cost of employing ice breaker ships to escort commercial 
vessels, the route has been demonstrated as more economical than the Suez route (Xu et al. 
2011). Adding the price of maritime piracy to the Suez route, the north route, at least for some 
months, become an interesting and safe alternative. 
Until now, the various military operations put in place in the Gulf of Aden and in particular the 
operation Atalanta of the European Union have not succeeded to curb down the occurrence of 
piracy incidents, but it has forced the pirates to extend their range of action. It is only by 
reducing significantly the number of hijacking that the European navies could transfer the 
supplementary cost to ship merchandizes from private shipping companies and consumers to 
national governments and taxpayers. Future research should be directed towards determining the 
loss of welfare and the markets distortions associated with each of these two options.
