I. SOURCES OF INFLATION IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA1 
A. Introduction 
1.      Since 2004, Papua New Guinea’s inflation has been low, compared to its historical 
level and peer countries’ inflation, in spite of rapid broad money growth and increased 
government expenditure. This chapter examines the possible explanations for this puzzle by 
analyzing the sources of inflation in Papua New Guinea. The results from the empirical 
analysis indicate that kina exchange rate movements are the most important determinant of 
inflation in Papua New Guinea, and correspondingly, appreciation of the kina has contributed 
to the low inflation. Changes in broad money growth, government expenditure, and oil prices 
also have had an impact on inflation. In particular, the findings suggest that recent rapid broad 
money growth, increased government expenditure, and higher oil prices could increase 
inflationary pressure in the near future. Cross-country analysis suggests that similar 
relationships between inflation and the above economic variables hold in Papua New Guinea’s 
peer countries as well. This analysis accordingly indicates that low inflation in Papua New 
Guinea compared to its peer countries was mainly caused by kina appreciation, in addition to 
relatively low, though increasing, government expenditure growth.  
2.      The structure of the remainder of this chapter is as follows: Section B reviews 
recent developments in inflation in Papua New Guinea and the economic environments 
surrounding it; Section C presents an empirical analysis of the relationship between inflation 
and different macroeconomic variables; Section D considers cross-county inflation analyses; 
and Section E presents the conclusions. 
B. Inflation and the Economic Environment 
3.      Papua New Guinea’s inflation declined 
sharply in 2003 and has remained in low single 
digits since 2004.2  
 
4.      Inflation historically has had a strong 
negative correlation with foreign exchange 
rate movements. The country experienced high 
inflation in line with depreciation of the kina 
exchange rate in 1995–96 (following the change 
in the foreign exchange regime from a pegged 
                                                 
1 Prepared by Aiko Mineshima. This chapter is based on a presentation delivered at the Bank of Papua New 
Guinea in Port Moresby in November 2007 and benefits from comments received at that time. 
2 The quality of CPI data for Papua New Guinea is poor: for example, the weights are outdated (based on a 
1975–76 Household Income and Expenditure Survey), and prices on dwelling rentals, which compose about 
3.9 percent of the headline CPI basket, have not been collected since 1991 and are therefore held constant.

regime to an independent float), 1998–2000, and 2001–03. Since 2004, with the roughly 
unchanged or somewhat appreciated kina exchange rate, inflation has been low. 
 
5.      Movements in headline inflation are mainly explained by tradable goods, which 
account for 77 percent of the CPI basket.3 Therefore, despite relatively large price increases in 
nontradable goods from 2006, headline inflation has been subdued.4 Given that most tradable 
goods are imported, changes in the exchange rate and prices abroad have an impact on PNG’s 
domestic goods prices. Further disaggregation of headline CPI indicates that for tradable goods, 
food has been a key source of underlying inflationary pressure. Prices of “transport/ 
communication” and “rent, council charges, and fuel/power” have increased since 2006, 
mainly pushed by high oil prices, but overall these were offset by lower prices of “drinks, 
tobacco, and betel nut” and “household equipment/operations,” resulting in lower headline 
inflation. 
 
6.      Papua New Guinea’s monetary conditions have remained roughly unchanged 
since mid-2004. The policy rate of the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG), the Kina Facility 
Rate (KFR), decreased from mid-2003 to September 2005 following a year of tightening in 
2002. Since September 2005, the KFR has been unchanged at 6 percent, a historically low 
level, while several of Papua New Guinea’s partner countries began raising policy rates in 
2002–04. The staff’s nominal monetary condition index (MCI) suggests that monetary 
conditions in Papua New Guinea have been roughly unchanged at the most relaxed level in the 
last 10 years from 2003 through 2006.5 However, in real terms, monetary conditions tightened 
                                                 
3 Tradable goods include: food; drinks, tobacco, and betel nut; clothing and footwear; household equipment; and 
motor vehicles. 
4 Nontradable goods include: rents, council charges, and fuel/power; transport and communication; and 
miscellaneous. 
5 The monetary condition index (MCI) is a weighted average of changes in the effective exchange rate and interest 
rates relative to a base period (in this case, end-1996). Reflecting the relative influence on monetary conditions, 
the weights for Papua New Guinea are 75 percent for the NEER and 25 percent for the interest rate. As Papua 
New Guinea is a small, open economy with a shallow financial market, the impact of exchange rate movements 
on monetary conditions is more significant than in more developed economies.

in 2003 in line with the REER appreciation, resulting from the spike in inflation, and has 
roughly unchanged since then.  
 
7.      Monetary aggregate growth began accelerating in 2004, as high prices for Papua 
New Guinea’s key commodity exports increased net foreign asset inflows. The BPNG 
intervened in the foreign exchange market to smooth exchange rate movements and avoid 
excessive appreciation of the kina against the U.S. dollar. It sterilized excess liquidity mainly 
by issuing central bank bills to maintain reserve money within its target growth rate. Net 
domestic asset growth began accelerating in 2005, driven by the recovery in private credit, 
which was in turn fueled by sound economic conditions, low interest rates, and improved 
financial intermediation. However, since 2006, net domestic asset growth has been near zero, 
as continued private credit growth has been offset by rising government deposits at the BPNG.

oil prices.6 This study uses simple econometric models that include exchange rate (NEER) and 
either broad money or government expenditure as endogenous explanatory variables. Model A 
includes broad money, while Model B includes government expenditure. Results from the 
exercises are as follows: 
• CPI and NEER are negatively correlated. A 1 percent appreciation in the kina is 
associated with a 0.87 percent decrease in CPI for Model A and 0.59 percent for Model 
B.7 
• CPI is positively correlated with broad money and central government expenditure. A 
1 percent increase in broad money is associated with a 0.23 percent increase in CPI 
while a 1 percent increase in central government expenditures is associated with 0.42 
percent increase in inflation.8 9 
• Inflation is positively correlated with a lagged oil prices. A 1 percent increase in oil 
price change in a period before is associated with 0.05 percent increase in an inflation 
change for Model A and 0.06 percent increase for Model B. 
• Inflation is positively correlated with the world inflation. Model A suggests a 1 percent 
increase in inflation in Papua New Guinea’s major trading partners is associated with 
1.37 percent increase in an inflation change. However, this variable is not statistically 
significant for Model B. 
• Error correction terms suggest that deviations from the equilibrium level are adjusted 
by 24 percent per quarter for Model A and 29 percent for Model B, meaning it takes 
about 12 months to adjust full deviations for Model A and 9 months for Model B. 
                                                 
6 Productivity (GDP gap or real GDP per capita) could be an explanatory variable of inflation. However, both the 
GDP gap and real GDP per capita do not work well for Papua New Guinea; the sign for the GDP gap is opposite 
to the our expectation, while NEER becomes statistically insignificant when real GDP per capita is included in the 
model. These results could be related to the poor quality of national accounts data. Nonetheless, given indications 
that productivity has not improved in recent years, inflationary pressure could be further increased if other 
conditions are unchanged. 
7 Thomas and al. (2006) estimated the exchange rate pass-through to underlying inflation by using OLS. The 
result shows the pass-through effect is approximately 50–60 percent. 
8 Including both broad money and government expenditures in a model causes multicollearity problem (the 
correlation coefficient of broad money growth and government expenditures is about 0.9). Other studies have 
shown that dropping one of correlated variables is the best way to solve this problem; Pearce and Reiter (1985) 
discusses the well-known two-stage strategy. 
9 Private credit, related to broad money, could be an explanatory variable of inflation. However, the econometric 
model becomes divergent if private credit is used instead of broad money.

9.      As the econometric analyses show, the nominal exchange rate (NEER) is the most 
important determinant of CPI in Papua New Guinea, followed by government 
expenditure and broad money. The correlation coefficients of CPI components and 
economic variables suggest that broad money is highly correlated with nontradable goods such 
as rent, council charges, and fuel/power and miscellaneous, while NEER has a high correlation 
with tradable goods such as food; drinks, tobacco, and betel nut; clothing and footwear; and 
household equipment and operations.10 Meanwhile, government expenditure is highly 
correlated with CPI components across the board.

D. Cross-Country Analysis 
10.      Cross-country analysis for twenty countries including Papua New Guinea and its 
peers suggests that the relationships between inflation and NEER movements, broad 
money growth, and central government expenditure growth that are observed in Papua 
New Guinea hold across the board.11 The coefficient of inflation and NEER for twenty 
countries including Papua New Guinea is -0.80, indicating a 1 percent appreciation in NEER is 
associated with 0.80 percent decrease in inflation. Meanwhile, the coefficient of inflation and 
central government expenditure is 0.42, indicating a 1 percent increase in central government 
expenditure is associated with 0.42 percent increase in inflation. Similarly, the coefficient of 
inflation and broad money growth is 0.41, indicating a 1 percent increase in broad money 
growth is associated with 0.41 percent increase in inflation.

11.      Papua New Guinea’s inflation has been low compared to its peer countries, while 
broad money has grown more rapidly than its peer countries since 2005. Lower inflation 
in Papua New Guinea has reflected higher appreciation of the exchange rate and lower 
increases in government expenditure compared to peer countries.12  
 
E. Conclusions and Policy Implications 
12.      The analyses in this chapter suggest that changes in the exchange rate are the 
most important determinant of inflation in Papua New Guinea, followed by government 
expenditure, broad money, and international oil prices. In addition, the BPNG’s proactive 
stance to absorb excess liquidity through open market operations as well as the low volatility in 
the kina might have contributed to the low inflation. However, looking ahead, the recent rapid 
                                                 
12 Looking at levels rather than growth rates, government expenditure and broad money as a share of nominal 
GDP have been higher for PNG than for its peer countries: the average of government expenditure as a share of 
nominal GDP for 1996-2006 is 31 percent for PNG and 23 percent for its peers, while the average of broad money 
as a share of nominal GDP for 1996–2006 is 34 percent for PNG and 21 percent for its peers.

broad money growth, increased government expenditure, and increased international oil prices 
could increase inflationary pressures. The results from the empirical analysis indicate that the 
current equilibrium inflation rate ranges from 5–8 percent. Given the increased inflationary 
pressures, the BPNG should be prepared to tighten monetary conditions as necessary to 
counter such pressures. At the same time, given current conditions, it remains appropriate for 
the BPNG to continue the current exchange rate policy of leaning against the wind to prevent 
too rapid exchange rate appreciation against the U.S. dollar, and sterilizing the resulting 
reserve accumulation to help contain inflation, while also balancing concerns regarding the 
inflationary impact of nominal depreciation on a trade-weighted basis.

ANNEX: TECHNICAL APPENDIX 
A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), which can capture both long-run and short-run 
relationships for an empirical analysis, is used in the paper. The data set for the estimation is on 
a quarterly basis, of which CPI data are seasonally adjusted by the Census X-12 while 
quarterly government expenditure data are calculated by interpolating the annual data in a 
quadratic-match average way. Independent variables are foreign exchange rate (NEER), broad 
money, central government expenditure, oil prices, and inflation in Papua New Guinea’s major 
trading partners (import value weighted average of CPI in Australia, Japan, New Zealand, the 
United States, and developing countries). Oil prices and inflation in Papua New Guinea’s

II. THE MONETARY TRANSMISSION MECHANISM IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA1 
A. Introduction 
1.      The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) has made progress towards attainment 
of an independent framework for the conduct of its monetary policy. From a system of 
controlled monetary management prior to 1994, following the move to a floating exchange 
rate that year, it has gradually moved to a market-based system of monetary management with 
price stability as its objective.  
2.      The main stimulus for this change was the significant reform of the banking and 
financial sector undertaken as part of a stabilization program begun earlier this decade. 
In 2000, the Central Bank Act was passed granting the central bank the needed independence 
for the conduct of its monetary policy. Other key reforms implemented since then include 
passage of the Financial Institutions Act and the Insurance Act, and reform of the pension 
system. Together, these reforms have precipitated a rapid increase in the size of the overall 
financial sector since 2000 (see Chapter 4).  
3.      Against this background of change in the institutional structure and size of the 
financial sector, an informed assessment of how and by what magnitude policy changes 
affect the economy would assist the successful design and implementation of monetary 
policy. This paper therefore analyzes the workings and effectiveness of the monetary 
transmission mechanism in Papua New Guinea. The remainder of the paper is organized as 
follows: Section B describes the current institutional structure in Papua New Guinea. Section 
C looks at interest-rate pass through, while Section D considers the evidence from vector 
autoregression analysis on the relationship between monetary policy variables and output and 
prices. Finally, Section E sets out the paper’s conclusions and policy implications. 
B. Background: Institutional and Operational Framework 
4.      As part of a broader agenda of financial sector reform, a new Central Bank Act 
was enacted in June 2000. 
• This Act set price stability as the primary macroeconomic goal of the BPNG and granted 
considerable policy independence in its pursuit. A Monetary Policy Committee was 
subsequently formed with responsibility for formulating appropriate policies that would 
help attain a stable inflation environment and macroeconomic stability.

in Port Moresby in November 2007 and benefits from comments received at that time.

• The central bank was then free to use whatever instruments it possessed to achieve price 
stability. To this end, the BPNG is required to publish semi-annual monetary policy 
statements, setting out its outlook for the economy and the intended policy response over 
the coming six months. 
• The new Act also sought to reduce the effect of fiscal operations on monetary management 
by limiting the amount that the government can borrow from the central bank.2 
• Papua New Guinea has also since adopted the principles of universal banking, promoted 
competition in the financial system through the nondiscriminatory treatment of foreign 
investment, privatized a public bank, introduced prudential regulations consistent with the 
Basle standards, and improved bank supervision significantly. In addition, a stock market 
and mutual funds started operations. 
5.      In determining its monetary policy stance, the BPNG reviews a broad range of 
factors influencing the evolution of inflation. These include developments in the global 
economy, the balance of payments, fiscal operations of the government, domestic activity and 
the exchange rate. Although the BPNG has price stability as its ultimate objective, it does not 
have an explicit inflation-targeting framework.3  
• The market component of Papua New Guinea’s economy is relatively open, with 
nearly one-half of GDP exported and a larger proportion of consumption imported. 
Appropriately, Papua New Guinea has a managed floating exchange rate regime that can 
help to buffer the domestic economy from external shocks. However, this also implies that 
the exchange rate does play a significant role in the transmission of monetary policy. While 
not targeting a particular level of the kina, the BPNG does seek to reduce short-term and 
seasonal volatility of the exchange rate through foreign exchange market intervention. 
• The BPNG uses a reserve money framework to conduct monetary policy operations. 
Through market instruments it seeks to control the growth of reserve money, which in turn, 
through the money multiplier, is expected to determine the evolution of broader monetary 
aggregates in a manner that would achieve the price objective.  
                                                 
2 The Bank of Papua New Guinea can provide a temporary advance to the government (limited originally to 
K100 million, and since adjusted for inflation) for a period of no longer than six months. However, the central 
bank can also hold government securities for monetary policy purposes, which are not subject to the borrowing 
limit. 
3 In part, this reflects the fact that there are insufficient timely data available, particularly on economic activity, 
for accurate inflation forecasts that would form the basis for a quantitative inflation target. 
 15 
 
• On a day-to-day basis, the BPNG gauges the tightness of its policy by the system-wide 
level of Exchange Settlement Account (ESA) balances. 4 These are accounts held at the 
BPNG by each commercial bank. 
6.      In implementing monetary policy, the Kina Facility Rate (KFR) plays a key role. 
Since February 2001, the BPNG has used the KFR as an indicator of the stance of monetary 
policy. Operationally, the KFR determines the rates on the central bank’s Kina Facility and 
Repurchase Agreement Facility (the latter by a margin relative to the KFR determined at the 
BPNG’s discretion). However, the KFR has a broader role as the official benchmark rate used 
to signal changes in the policy stance. Decisions to vary or keep unchanged this rate are 
explained publicly relative to the outlook for achieving the BPNG’s inflation objective.  
• In practice, changes in the KFR have been infrequent. It has remained unchanged at 
6 percent since September 2005. In addition, average KFR changes measured over one 
month, at between 50 and -100 basis 
points, are small relative to comparator 
policy rate changes in transition countries.  
• Another instrument actively used to 
manage liquidity and influence interest 
rates are open market operations, most 
recently using central bank bills and 
repurchase operations, which allow it to 
conduct open market operations at a 
higher frequency than the weekly treasury 
bill auction cycle. Also, the Repurchase Agreement Facility (RAF) operates as an 
overnight unsecured borrowing and lending arrangement; as noted above, its interest rate is 
based on the prevailing KFR.  
• The Kina Facility Rate and the RAF rate together anchor the short end of the yield curve. 
However, treasury bill rates have moved below the deposit rate for the Kina Facility in 
recent years, possibly reflecting market expectations for further reductions in the KFR 
(Figure 3). Given the size and persistence of the deviation, it may also reflect the KFR’s 
loss of credibility as a signal of the BPNG’s policy intentions. 
7.      The BPNG can also influence liquidity conditions on a daily basis through its 
interventions in the foreign exchange market. The low interest rates associated with current 
                                                 
4 All interbank transfers are settled through these accounts, which represent “same-day” funds. The balances in 
these accounts do not include deposits used to satisfy reserve requirements, and therefore ESA levels represent 
the excess reserves of the banking system. The level of ESA balances is affected by many factors beyond the 
control of Bank of Papua New Guinea, including government expenditure and tax collections, foreign exchange 
transactions, and changes in the check float.

monetary conditions of high liquidity could lead to short-term capital outflows. If this occurred, 
and the BPNG sold foreign exchange to ease the resulting pressure on the exchange rate, it 
simultaneously would withdraw liquidity. However, the recent experience has been that the 
BPNG has generally been able to manage liquidity using its domestic instruments, and so has 
been able to maintain an adequate level of reserves. 
8.      In practice, the main instrument for monetary policy has been the repurchase 
facility (or repo) rate. As indicated in the monetary policy transmission mechanism depicted 
in Figure 2, the repo rate has direct effects on other variables in the economy, such as other 
interest rates, the exchange rate, money and credit, other asset prices and decisions on spending 
and investment. Thus, changes in the repo rate affect the demand for and supply of goods and 
services. Relative demand pressure and the supply capacity of the economy then becomes a 
key factor influencing domestic inflationary pressures. In addition, imported inflation, 
influenced by exchange-rate movements, plays an important role in contributing to price 
movements.5

C. Stylized Facts: Interest Rate Pass-Through 
9.      To achieve the objectives of monetary policy, the key transmission channel is the 
pass-through from the repo rate to other interest rates. Trends in nominal and real interest 
rates suggests that the repo and other interest rates have moved in the same direction 
since 2001 (Figure 3). Since 2003, repo rates have been declining, as have other rates. Simple 
OLS regressions of the contemporaneous and lagged KFR on the repo rate and of the repo rate

on market rates are used to investigate interest rate pass-through. The results show that changes 
in the KFR translate quickly into changes in the repo rate (Table 1), as would be expected. 
However, changes in policy rates do not appear to translate as quickly or fully to 
market-determined interest rates. For each one percentage point increase in the repo rate, the 
Treasury bill rate changes by 75 basis points. Cross correlations of interest rates with credit, 
output and prices display mixed results (Table 2). While the repo rate appears to be positively 
correlated with inflation, it seems to have little relationship to output and credit.

D. Evidence From Vector Autoregression Analysis 
10.      This section examines the relationships between monetary policy variables and 
output and prices using a Vector Autoregression Analysis (VAR). The VAR has several 
advantages: 
• VARs have been used extensively in the study of monetary policy transmission processes 
as they represent dynamic systems of equations in which the current level of each variable 
in the system depends on past movements in that variable and all other variables in the 
system. A key advantage of the methodology is that it imposes minimal restrictions on how 
monetary shocks affect the economy.  
• Moreover, the methodology recognizes explicitly the simultaneity between monetary 
policy and macroeconomic developments; that is, the dependence of monetary policy on 
other economic variables, as well as the dependence of economic variables on monetary 
policy.  
• Once estimated, VARs can be used to simulate the response over time of any variable in 
the set to either an own disturbance or a disturbance to any other variable in the system and 
to produce a variance decomposition of the variable. 
The mathematical representation of a VAR is: 
 tptpttt yyyy εααα −−− +++= ........................221  ( 1 ) 
 
Where yt is a k vector of endogenous variables, α1,..... α p are matrices of coefficients to be 
estimated, and εt is a vector of innovations that may be contemporaneously correlated but are 
uncorrelated with their own lagged values and uncorrelated with all of the right-hand side 
variables. Given that only lagged values of the endogenous variables show on the right-hand 
side of the equations, simultaneity is not a problem, and OLS yields consistent estimates. 
 
11.      The VAR is identified using recursive Cholesky decomposition. As the 
reduced-form errors are typically correlated, the Cholesky decomposition isolates the 
underlying structural errors by recursive orthogonalization, with the innovation in the first 
equation untransformed, the innovation in the second equation taken as orthogonal to the first, 
and so on. 
 
 20 
 
Data and choice of variables6 
 
12.      The analysis focuses on the period since the passage of key financial sector 
reforms, including the Central Bank Act, and considers the effects of three policy 
instruments, namely interest rates, the exchange rate, and the money supply. We use the 
repo rate, which is (in connection with the KFR), the key short-term interest rate used by the 
BPNG to signal its monetary policy stance. The second policy-related variable is the nominal 
exchange rate (x). We focus on the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) to examine the 
effects of exchange rate changes on output and prices.7 Output is measured as real GDP (y) and 
the consumer price index (p) is taken as the measure of the general price level. All data are 
expressed in natural logs and are seasonally adjusted using ARIMA X12, with the exception of 
the repo rate, which is in levels and not seasonally adjusted. 
13.      The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test suggests that the null hypothesis that 
the variables are I(1) cannot be rejected. Given that the monetary transmission mechanism 
is a short-run phenomenon, an analysis of the economy’s long run behavior is not carried out in 
this paper. This allows us to conduct the analysis in levels, thereby allowing for implicit 
cointegrating relationships in the data.8 The lag length of the VAR estimation was selected 
using the Akaike (AIC) and Schwartz (SC) Information Criteria, and the residuals were tested 
for autocorrelation. Both tests suggest a lag of the first order, and the Lagrange Multiplier Test 
suggests that the residuals are not serially correlated. 
The Basic Model 
 
14.      In the baseline model, the vector of endogenous variables consists of real GDP (yt), 
the consumer price index (pt), repo rate (repot), and the nominal exchange rate (neert): 
 ],,,[ tttt neerrepopyY =  ( 2 ) 
 
The ordering of the variables was based on the speed with which the variables respond to 
shocks. Real output is assumed to be the least responsive, as would be expected for a small, 
open, developing economy, like Papua New Guinea’s, with many structural rigidities. A 
fundamental assumption is that in the short run, shocks to the policy variables have no 
                                                 
6 Monthly data for 2001–06 are used for the econometric analyses. The annual GDP series is converted into a 
monthly series using quadratic match sum feature in Eviews and the quarterly CPI series is converted using the 
linear match last feature. 
7 Using the NEER as opposed to a real effective exchange rate makes it easier to distinguish the exchange rate 
channel from other channels. 
8 Most of the empirical literature on VARs has tended to estimate VARs that are unrestricted in levels (Favero, 
2001). Sims, Stock, and Watson (1990) show that if enough of the variables are cointegrated, an analysis in levels 
is still correct because the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the reduced-form VAR efficiently estimates 
the cointegrating relationship. 
 21 
 
contemporaneous impact on output and prices due to the real sector’s sluggish reaction to 
monetary and exchange rate shocks. The nominal interest rate responds contemporaneously to 
shocks to output and prices, but not to changes in financial variables. Finally, the nominal 
exchange rate responds contemporaneously to all types of shocks.9 
 
Impulse responses and variance decomposition 
 
15.      To observe the influence of monetary policy on output and prices, we look at the 
impulse response functions (Figure 4). The results are summarized as follows: 
 
• An unexpected, temporary rise in the repo rate tends to be followed by a sluggish, but 
persistent decline in output. Variance decomposition indicates that, after 2 years, monetary 
policy accounts for 42 percent of the fluctuation in output, with own shocks accounting for 
broadly the amount of the variance.  
• An unexpected, temporary rise in the repo rate is followed by a decline in prices, that is 
significant between 5 to 17 months, peaking after around 15 months following the shock.  
                                                 
9 Alternative orderings of the variables in the VAR produced broadly similar qualitative findings as in the 
baseline model.

• Likewise, the nominal exchange rate responds strongly to an exogenous increase in the 
repo rate. An unexpected and temporary rise in the repo rate tends to be followed by an 
immediate nominal appreciation, with the impact culminating 9–12 months after the shock.  
i. Interest Rate Channel 
16.      To examine the interest rate channel more closely, we added to the basic model 
(Equation 2) the lending rate for new loans. The variables in this expanded VAR have the 
following ordering: real output, prices, repo rate, lending rate on new loans, and NEER. Figure 
5 presents impulse responses stemming from innovations in monetary policy (increase in the 
repo rate) and bank lending rates. The lending rate responds immediately and significantly to 
an unexpected change in the repo rate. Output and prices, however, do not respond 
significantly to lending rate shocks. The results highlight the transmission of changes in the 
key policy interest rate to other interest rates in the economy.  
17.      Importantly, the results also highlight the weakness of the interest rate channel in 
Papua New Guinea, as changes in bank lending rates do not seem to affect economic 
activity and prices. Variance decomposition suggests that, after two years, interest on new 
lending account for 11 percent of the fluctuation in output, and just 2 percent of the fluctuation 
in prices.

ii. Bank Lending Channels 
 
Bank credit 
 
18.      To examine the importance of credit in the monetary transmission mechanism, 
we included the natural log of seasonally adjusted domestic credit in the VAR. The 
variables in this expanded VAR have the following ordering: real output, prices, bank credit, 
and the repo rate. Bank credit appears to be important for the monetary transmission 
mechanism and a significant source of independent shocks to prices. A shock to bank loans 
results in an almost immediate increase in prices that is significant for about a year (Figure 6). 
Variance decomposition suggests that, after one year, credit accounts for 15 percent of the 
fluctuation in prices (Annex, Table 1). 
19.      Shocks to bank credit do not appear to elicit an output response that conforms to 
what one would expect from the theory—i.e., a positive shock to credit results in a 
negative output response. This result may be explained by the still relatively modest share 
that credit to the economy has in total bank assets. Commercial banks with limited credit 
assessment capacity, in an environment where property rights are not adequately defined, and 
where corporate governance is weak, have tended to invest their funds in government 
securities rather than in credit portfolios.

20.      To examine the issue of whether changes in the bank reserves have implications for 
output and prices in Papua New Guinea, we add bank reserves to Equation 2. As can be seen 
from Figure 7, the impulse response of output and prices to a change in bank reserves is not 
significant. Variance decomposition suggests that, after two years, a shock to reserve money 
account for only 2½ percent of the fluctuation in output, and only 2 percent of the fluctuation 
in prices. These results can be explained by structural rigidities in the banking system, 
including commercial banks’ preference to invest in government paper rather than lending 
operations. The results are consistent with Saxegaard (2006), which uses a threshold vector 
autoregression model for a number of Sub-Saharan African countries and finds that excess 
liquidity in the region weakens the monetary transmission mechanism, and thus the ability of 
monetary authorities to influence demand conditions in the economy.  
 
iii. Exchange Rate Channel 
21.      Evidence on the exchange rate channel suggests that prices respond strongly to 
the exchange rate. An appreciation of the NEER results in an almost immediate (within 2 
months) decline in prices, which is significant for 10 months after the initial shock. The rapid 
pass-through of exchange rate changes to prices is consistent with findings from other 
countries. The results suggest that the exchange rate plays a significant role for monetary 
transmission in Papua New Guinea.

E. Conclusions And Policy Implications 
22.      To gain insights into the workings of the Papua New Guinea economy, we 
investigated various channels of the monetary transmission mechanism. While the results 
should be interpreted with some caution given the level of noise in the data, evidence presented 
in this paper suggests that monetary policy has been successful in influencing prices and 
market interest rates. It has been, however, less successful in influencing domestic output.  
• Policy instrument (repo): We find evidence to support the view that changes in the 
BPNG’s key policy instrument (the repo rate) have a significant and rapid impact on prices. 
Changes in the repo rate also affect output sluggishly, and with a significant lag. An 
unexpected and temporary rise in the repo rate also tends to be followed by nominal 
exchange rate appreciation. 
• Bank lending rate: The lending rate responds immediately and significantly to an 
unexpected change in the repo rate. Output and prices, however, do not respond 
significantly to lending rate shocks.  
• Bank credit: We find no statistical link in our data between monetary policy and bank 
credit, nor between bank credit and economic activity. Bank credit appears, however, to be 
an important source of independent shocks to prices. 
• Bank reserves: Our results also show that monetary policy does not seem to have an effect 
on bank reserves. In addition, the response of output and prices to a change in bank 
reserves is not significant. These result could be explained by structural rigidities in the 
banking system, including commercial banks’ preference to invest in government paper, 
despite a significant amount of excess liquidity.

• Exchange rate: The nominal exchange rate responds immediately and significantly to an 
unexpected change in the repo rate rates, possibly reflecting capital mobility associated 
with interest rate differentials vis-à-vis other countries. The appreciation of the currency 
following monetary tightening in turn makes imports cheaper, thereby decreasing the 
overall price level and the rate of inflation. 
23.      While the BPNG has developed and improved its set of monetary instruments 
over the years, the instruments could be more effective, to allow the various channels of 
monetary transmission to operate most effectively. The authorities could consider an 
in-depth assessment of the financial system to take stock, identify, and address remaining 
weaknesses in the sector. These include improving governance of the central bank and 
financial institutions, strengthening the regulatory framework, as well as enhancing the legal 
framework, with a view to improving the monetary transmission mechanism to the real sector. 
In addition, strengthening the quality, frequency and timeliness of price statistics and 
indicators of economic activity would contribute to an improved understanding of the 
monetary transmission mechanism.

III. PAPUA NEW GUINEA: EXPORT PERFORMANCE AND COMPETITIVENESS1 
A. Introduction 
1.      Export performance is a key factor driving both economic growth and stability in 
a small open economy like Papua New Guinea. Accordingly, this paper reviews a broad set 
of indicators of export competitiveness, including estimation of the equilibrium real effective 
exchange rate (REER) using different methodologies. The REER appears to be broadly in 
equilibrium at present. However, other indicators suggest Papua New Guinea faces structural 
competitiveness problems, including a weak business environment, poor physical and 
knowledge infrastrucuture, land tenure issues, crime, and weak governance, which hamper 
overall export competitiveness. Looking forward, Papua New Guinea would benefit from 
accelerating the structural reforms necessary to improve the investment environment for the 
nonmineral economy.  
2.      The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows: Section B reviews Papua New 
Guinea’s export performance over the last decade. Section C considers different measurements 
of price competitiveness and Section D estimates the equilibrium real effective exchange rate. 
Section E assesses structural competitiveness in Papua New Guinea. Finally, the conclusions 
are presented in Section F. 
B. Export Performance 
3.      Since 1995, Papua New Guinea’s export performance has been lackluster, 
notwithstanding large mineral discoveries 
during the 1980s and early 1990s. Mineral 
export volumes have generally been on a 
declining trend reflecting depletion of proven 
reserves (especially for petroleum) and until 
recently a lack of new investment in 
exploration activities. Nonmineral export 
volumes have increased somewhat, mainly 
because of increased palm oil acreages, 
logging, and production of copra oil. Despite 
this increase, nonmineral export values have 
declined significantly because of lower average prices during the review period. Analysis of 
the causes of this poor export performance is particularly important because growth in Papua 
New Guinea is closely linked to exports. Indeed, real GDP growth has been generally modest, 
averaging about 1 percent annually for the period 1995–2006. Some salient developments are 
summarized below.

Papua New Guinea: Export Values, 1995 - 2006
(Annual growth)
  
31
• Export values grew at an average rate of about 5.3 percent for the period 1995–2006. 
Mineral exports performed somewhat better (growth rate of about 7.3 percent) than 
nonmineral exports (growth rate of about 3.3 percent).  
• The average export growth rates masked very high year-to-year fluctuations in 
virtually all the products, with an overall coefficient of variation of 18. At least 
95 percent of Papua New Guinea’s exports are commodities, with raw minerals 
accounting for about 80 percent of total exports.  
• Both price and volume trends affected the observed trend in values. For the 
period 1995–2006, average export volumes grew by only about -0.8 percent per 
annum. Mineral export volumes grew by -1 percent, while nonmineral exports volumes 
grew by 1 percent. Strong export volume growth was observed mainly in palm oil, and 
to some extent, in tea, copper and cocoa.  
• Mineral exports were negatively affected by declining oil reserves, the closure in 1989 
of the large Bougainville copper mine, and the virtual cessation of mining exploration 
activities and sharp decline in oil sector exploration until the recent up tick in global 
mining and oil prices. Petroleum export volumes declined by 7.7 percent on average 
during 1995–2006. This was partially offset by increased production at the Ok Ted 
copper mine. 
• Overall average export prices increased by about 7.2 percent per annum in U.S. dollar 
terms during 1995–2006. Mineral price trends were generally favorable over the period 
under study. Average mineral prices increased by 11 percent, while nonmineral prices 
increased by about 1.5 percent. Prior to 2002, poor price trends were observed virtually 
across the board with the exception of oil.  
4.      Papua New Guinea’s export growth can be decomposed into three broad factors: global 
demand, product and markets, and competitiveness. 
Global Demand  
• Part of export growth can be attributed to rising international demand; i.e., the stronger 
global import demand is for a particular product, the stronger would export value 
growth for that product be. This has been the main influence on export value growth in 
Papua New Guinea. Rising mineral prices have increased the share of mineral exports 
in total exports from 70 percent during 1991–99 to 77 percent in 2000–06 despite 
declining export volumes. 
  
32
  
Product and Market  
5.      While Papua New Guinea’s share of the world exports market has been 
improving in value terms since 2002 with the rise in commodity prices, it has been 
declining in volume terms over the past decade. Over a longer-term, an increase in market 
share could be expected if Papua New Guinea’s exports mainly comprised products for which 
world demand is growing more rapidly than the global average. However, against the 
background of a commodity demand boom, while world trade volumes increased by around 
7.1 percent per annum over the period 1995–2006, over the same period, Papua New Guinea’s 
export volume growth averaged around -0.8 percent per annum. As a result, the share of 
country’s goods in world exports has made significant losses since the mid-1995 in volume 
terms. Although nonmineral export volume has increased recently, the increase has been less 
than the world’s increase.

• The range of Papua New Guinea’s exports is limited and has been relatively 
unchanged over the years. Exports consist mainly of commodities, including 
minerals and fuel, wood products, and agricultural products. Other areas, such as 
manufactured products, contribute little. 
 
• Export performance can also be affected by changes in the demand for exports 
across regions such that an increase in global market share would be expected if a 
country’s exports were destined for markets that grow more rapidly than the global 
average. However, Australia remains Papua New Guinea’s main trading 
partner—reflecting historical ties, rather than the fast growing emerging economies to 
the north.

C. Assessing Competitiveness: Wage and Cost Indicators 
Labor costs 
6.      Wage costs are an important component in the total costs of producing exports; 
unfortunately, poor data availability bar a thorough analysis on these grounds in Papua 
new Guinea. Unit labor costs in the traded sector relative to the main trading partners, 
expressed in a common currency, are 
generally accepted as a useful proxy for cost 
competitiveness. However, the latest data 
collected for Papua New Guinea dates from 
the mid-1990s. A study by Duncan and 
Lawson (1997) found that Papua New 
Guinea’s unit labor costs were high compared 
to competitor countries, such as Malaysia, 
Indonesia, and the Philippines. For the 
period 1970–1994, unit labor costs for 
Malaysia and the Philippines averaged 
40 percent of those of the United States, and those of the Indonesia averaged 0 percent,2 while 
Papua New Guinea averaged 80–100 percent. Duncan and Lawson show that the main reason 
for the high unit labor costs in Papua New Guinea was poor productivity performance. 
Available data since the Duncan and Lawson study was completed suggest there has likely 
been no improvement in productivity, since the mid-1990s.3

Real Effective Exchange Rates 
7.      Real effective exchange rate 
(REER) indicators suggest that price 
competitiveness has remained roughly 
unchanged over the past decade. The REER 
has remained largely stable since the August 
1994 devaluation (depreciation by about 
0.37 percent for the period 
January 1995–July 2007), as appreciation on 
a nominal effective exchange rate basis was 
offset by relatively lower domestic inflation. 
8.      Pair wise correlation analysis shows no evidence of an inter-relationship between 
the REER and export performance in Papua New Guinea. Granger causality tests seem to 
indicate no causality between exports and the REER.4 Nonetheless, it would be premature to 
conclude that changes in the REER would not affect export performance. 
• First, it is likely that the limited impact of the exchange rate on export performance 
reflects the duality between the mineral sector and the nonmineral sector. The mining 
industry has largely operated at world prices as an enclave with few linkages to the rest 
of the economy. 
• Second, the results are consistent with the view that export growth has generally been a 
result of discovery of new minerals and, to some extent, the extension of cultivated 
areas (e.g., palm oil and copra), rather than the emergence of nontraditional exports. 
Thus, export volumes would have been little affected by foreign currency-denominated 
prices (see Mlachila 2002). 
9.      Other research has found that a real depreciation in Papua New Guinea has a 
positive impact on the nonmineral sector, for example, by opening up new markets.5  
D. Assessing Competitiveness: REER Estimates   
10.      This section seeks answers to the question of whether the REER is in line with 
macroeconomic fundamentals. As estimates of equilibrium real effective exchange rates 
(EREERs) tend to be quite sensitive to the methodology used, especially in countries like 
                                                 
4 The hypothesis that changes in export values do not Granger-cause changes in the REER is rejected at the 
5 percent significance levels. P-values of 0.233 and 0.665 suggests that we cannot reject the hypothesis. 
5 In a detailed study of the tree-crop sector in Papua New Guinea, Kannapiram (2000) argued that kina 
depreciation achieved the twin objectives of improving competitiveness and increasing profit margins, especially 
for coffee and oil palm production and exports.

Papua New Guinea with severe data limitations, this study uses three different approaches: the 
purchasing power parity approach (PPP), the macroeconomic balance approach, and the 
behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach. 
Purchasing Power Parity Approach 
11.      Assessing real exchange rate misalignment under the Purchasing Power Parity 
(PPP) approach involves a comparison of prices of a basket of goods produced by the 
home country with those of a comparable basket 
abroad and calculating the exchange rate that 
would equate them. Assuming the 
Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis holds, a country’s 
prices should become relatively higher as the 
country becomes relatively richer. The real 
exchange rate calculated on a PPP basis—measured 
as the ratio of the domestic price level to 
international prices—is currently below what would 
be predicted given Papua New Guinea’s relative 
income. However, the deviation is small compared 
to other countries. 
 
Macroeconomic Balance Approach  
12.      Macroeconomic Balance approach estimates the REER that simultaneously 
achieves internal and external balance. To this end, the fundamental equilibrium exchange 
rate (FEER) is defined as the exchange rate that will equate the current account to the structural 
savings/investment balance in the medium term. The estimation process comprises the 
following three steps:  
• estimating an equilibrium relationship between current account balances and a set of 
fundamentals;  
• computing an equilibrium current account (current account norm) from these 
relationships as a function of the levels of fundamentals projected to prevail in the 
medium term; and  
• calculating the REER adjustment that would close the gap between the estimated 
current account norm and the underlying current account balance (the current account 
projection for 2012).

13.      The fundamental variables used 
for the model are the following: 
demographic variables affecting the saving 
rate (old dependency ratio and population 
growth rate), initial net foreign assets 
(share of nominal GDP), fiscal balance 
(share of nominal GDP), relative income 
(PPP-based per-capita income relative to 
Australian data), relative real interest rate 
(relative to Australian data), and mineral 
exports (share of nominal GDP). 
14.      Given the estimated import/exports elasticities to exchange rate movements, the 
REER would need to appreciate by 0.4 percent to close the gap between the underlying 
current account balance (-2.5 percent) and the current account norm (3.1 percent).6 7  
Behavioral Equilibrium Exchange Rate Approach 
15.      This approach estimates the EREER by identifying structural determinants using 
a behavioral exchange rate model. Clark and McDonald (1998, 2000) popularized the 
behavioral equilibrium exchange rate (BEER) approach as a modeling strategy designed to 
seek a long run relationship between observed real exchange rates and a set of fundamental 
determinants derived from a theoretical real exchange rate model. An attractive feature of the 
model is that the real exchange rate is required to be in equilibrium only in terms of its value 
given by the appropriate set of explanatory variables over a specific sample period. This allows 
representation of the equilibrium real exchange rate in terms of the dynamic structure that 
generates the data on the real exchange rate and its fundamental determinants, even though the 
variables themselves are derived from a long run structural model.8 
 
                                                 
6 The results should be treated with some caution given the limited data set and degrees of freedom. 
7 Annual data for 1992–2006 are used for the econometric analyses and are shown in Table 1. Elasticity of 
exports/imports/current accounts with respect to the REER are assumed to be: 
• Exports: -0.46 (one percent appreciation in REER decreases exports in share of GDP by 0.46). 
• Imports: -0.62 (one percent appreciation in REER decreases imports in share of GDP by 0.62). 
• Current accounts: -0.46*(exports in share of GDP)-(-0.62)*(imports in share of GDP).

where the notation used is defined in Box 1. The figure below shows the behavior of the key 
fundamental variables since 1994. The analysis shows that commodity price movements, 
productivity, real interest rates differentials vis-à-vis trading-partner countries, the size of the 
fiscal balance, net foreign assets position, and the debt service ratio explain much of the 
long-run behavior of the real effective exchange rate.  
The results of the estimation are summarized in the table below and show that:  
• An increase in the terms of trade of 1 percent is associated with a depreciation of 
0.16 percent in the real effective exchange rate. 
• An increase in real interest rate differential of one percentage point is associated with 
an appreciation of 0.01 percent in the real effective exchange rate. 
• An increase in real GDP per capita relative to trading partners of 1 percent is associated 
with an appreciation of 0.10 percent in the real effective exchange rate. 
• An improvement in the fiscal balance of 1 percentage point of GDP is associated with 
an appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of around 1.4 percent.  
• An improvement in the debt service ratio of 1 percentage point is associated with an 
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of around 0.4 percent. 
                                                 
9 An important advantage over single-equation methods (such as the Engle-Granger method) is that this approach 
accounts for simultaneity and autocorrelation of the endogenous variables. The VECM also permits the inclusion 
of additional exogenous variables that may help explain the short-run behavior of the real exchange rate.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Determinants of the Exchange Rate 
• Terms of trade (LTOT): The impact of the terms of trade on the real exchange rate is 
theoretically ambiguous.1 Changes in terms of trade entail changes in domestic prices of
importables, and as a result, generate inter-temporal and intra-temporal substitution 
effects as well as income effects. This makes the net effect on the equilibrium real 
exchange rate (ERER) ambiguous (Edwards 1989, 1994).  
• The real interest rate (RID): An increase in a country’s real interest rate relative to its
trading partners tends to appreciate the ERER. For an economy that is highly open to 
international capital markets, a higher domestic real interest relative to that of its trading
partners creates opportunities for capital inflows. 
• Productivity growth differential (LYPD): An increase in productivity relative to other 
countries leads to an improvement in the current account, thereby appreciating the real 
exchange rate. Given lack of data availability in Papua New Guinea, we employ real 
GDP per capita with respect to trading partner countries as a proxy for the 
Balassa-Samuelson effect.  
• Trade policy (Open). Permanently higher levels of trade taxes (i.e., reducing the 
openness of the economy) lead to ERER appreciation. Consumption becomes more 
expensive with the increase in the relative price of importables, while also creating 
excess demand of both exportables and nontraded goods. The excess demand in the 
nontradable goods sector permits an appreciation of the ERER.  
• Net capital inflows (LNFAGDP). Net capital inflows (as a percentage of GDP) are 
used as a proxy for capital controls. In models of ERER determination, a permanent 
increase in net capital inflows (interpreted as a reduction in the tax on foreign 
borrowing) leads to an appreciation of the ERER. 
• Fiscal policy (FIS): Fiscal policy has an ambiguous effect on the equilibrium real 
exchange rate: the direction of its quantitative influence depends on the sectoral 
composition of the change in government expenditure.  
• The debt service ratio (DSR). If the debt service ratio falls permanently, this will 
improve the sustainability of the current account and thus lead to an appreciation of the 
ERER. If a country is a net debtor, an increase in the debt burden will deteriorate its 
current account. The real exchange rate will depreciate and make correction of current 
account imbalances possible. If a country is a net creditor, higher interest income from 
loans will lead to a current account surplus and the real exchange rate will appreciate.

17.      The level of the exchange rate appears to be in line with fundamentals. The 
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) was obtained by imposing the coefficients of the 
long-run equation on the permanent values of the fundamentals using Hodrick-Prescott (HP) 
and Christiano-Fitzerald (CF) filters.  
• Relative to its equilibrium values (HP and CF), the actual exchange rate was mostly 
undervalued by a small margin during 1994–2007. There were three periods of 
significant undervaluation during 1995, 1998–2000, and 2001–02, and three brief 
periods of small to moderate overvaluation in 1997, 2000, and 2005.  
• The first resulted from the use of a nominal exchange rate anchor that was not 
supported by a consistent fiscal policy in the period prior to 1994. It also reflected 
broad inconsistencies in the conduct of macroeconomic policies and in the fundamental 
variables.  
• By end-2006, the actual RER was somewhat more depreciated than the estimated 
equilibrium exchange rate. The increase in the ERER is due to various factors. The 
increase in the terms of trade contributed to kina depreciation as income effects 
dominated substitution effects. However, the improvement in the fiscal balance, 
increase in net foreign assets, and small increase in the real interest rate differential 
partly offset these terms of trade effects.

E. Assessing Competitiveness: Structural Indicators 
18.      While it appears that price competitiveness is broadly appropriate in Papua New 
Guinea, structural factors are also important determinants of competitiveness. The 
structural factors include the business environment (including entrepreneurship, tax regime, 
regulations, access to finance, and governance), physical and knowledge infrastructure, law 
and order, land policy, and trade policy. These elements are important determinants of current 
and future productivity, which is one of the factors that influence competitiveness. One 
indication of Papua New Guinea’s relative structural competitiveness is the comparatively low 
level of foreign direct investment relative to other resource rich countries in Asia and low 
income countries globally. Foreign direct investment is particularly low outside of the mineral 
sector.  
  
19.      Survey-based indicators of the business environment suggest structural 
impediments to external competitiveness exist. Although Papua New Guinea’s ranking in 
the World Bank’s ease-of-doing-business database compares relatively favorably with other 
countries in the region, key areas rank poorly. These include enforcing contracts, dealing with 
licenses, getting credit, and trading across borders. Another disincentive to investment is high 
political risks due to corruption, bureaucracy quality, and ethnic tensions. The World Bank’s 
CPIA index and Transparency International both rank Papua New Guinea poorly on these 
issues.10 In addition, the evolution of rankings indicates that the structural reforms undertaken 
to date have yet to improve competitiveness in a meaningful way.  
                                                 
10 International comparisons of structural indicators are often based on survey evidence and, therefore, need to be 
interpreted with caution.

20.      Papua New Guinea suffers from infrastructure bottlenecks, even when compared 
to other low income countries. Due to its mountainous terrain, most of the country is 
impassable, as evidenced by its low proportion of paved roads (less than 5 percent). Access to 
telecommunications is limited and unit costs are high. At the same time, Papua New Guinea 
also has low social indicators, indicating a weak knowledge infrastructure. Given the very high 
annual population growth rate, the country faces considerable challenges in education, 
especially to increase its school enrolment and retention ratios. In the health sector, a key 
challenge is to increase access to primary health care facilities, and to reduce the prevalence of 
communicable diseases. 
 
21.      Papua New Guinea’s law and order problems and related security costs also have 
an adverse impact on the business environment. In addition to direct costs of security, 
estimated at 3 percent of total business cost on average, there are indirect costs. Security 
concerns constrain the geographical area in which a company can operate. Overall labor costs 
are increased to compensate employees for the added personal insecurity, especially for 
imported labor. Security concerns also generally lead to reduced intensity of capital equipment 
usage as during certain hours, for example, at night. Finally, security issues occupy 
management’s time, thereby reducing overall productivity. 
22.      The lack of transferable land titles is considered another structural impediment, 
with about 97 percent of the land communally owned. Arguments for land reform include: 
the traditional tenure system reduces the incentive for landholders to invest in their land since 
the cost of improvement is privately borne by the landholder while the benefits are socialized; 
the inability to use land as collateral makes it difficult for landholders to borrow money to 
finance new investments; and the lack of well-defined property rights over land can divert 
resources into activities focused on rent-seeking rather than wealth creation. Efforts to 
modernize land tenure by establishing a national land registry system have met with little 
success to date due to popular opposition, although there have been some successful individual 
ventures. For example, in some oil palm estates clearly demonstrable benefits (e.g., royalties, 
jobs, social services) have encouraged some tribes to lease their land, contributing to a 
considerable increase in the exports of palm oil. 
23.      Given its high level of trade openness, Papua New Guinea appropriately maintains 
one of the least restrictive trade regimes in the region. It fares well relative to comparator 
countries in terms of both the trade restrictiveness index as well as average import tariffs,

which are little over 5 percent, following a recently completed tariff reform.11 The government 
is currently conducting an overall review of its trade policy. 
 
F. Conclusions and Policy Implications 
24.      While Papua New Guinea has enjoyed strengthened export performance in 
recent years, the improvement mainly reflects the significant rise in world commodity 
prices as exports remain concentrated in the mining and petroleum sectors. In volume 
terms, Papua New Guinea has seen a declining share in total global trade. Staff estimates 
indicate that the exchange rate is broadly in line with macroeconomic fundamentals at present. 
In contrast, comparisons of unit labor costs across countries suggest a cost competitiveness 
problem, though data availability limits a more thorough analysis and makes comparisons 
difficult. Available data also indicate a structural competitiveness problem.  
25.      Given volatility and scarcity of resources in the mineral sector, sustained 
improvement requires enhanced productivity growth and resource reallocation to the 
nonmineral sector. Foreign direct investment and domestic private investment are key to 
achieving the necessary economic transformation, but boosting investment will depend on the 
successful implementation of structural reforms aimed at improving the overall investment 
environment. 
                                                 
11 There are four major ad valorem tariff rates (0, 15, 25, 40) and some additional specific tariff 
rates (such as 70 percent on sugar and 20 percent on mackerel).

Technical Appendix 
Johansen Vector Error Correction 
In order to investigate the existence of a long-run, co-integrating, relationship between the real 
effective exchange rate and the variables discussed above, our study employs the Johansen 
(1995) maximum likelihood estimator, which corrects for autocorrelation and endogeneity 
parametrically using a vector error-correction mechanism (VECM) specification.12 
 
The Johansen methodology can be described as follows. Define a vector: 
 
 ],,,,,,,[ DSRFISKflowOPENLYPCRIDLTOTLREERXt =  ( 3 )
 
and assume that the vector has a VAR representation of the form: 
 
 t
p
i
tt xx εη +∏+= ∑
=
−
1
1  ( 4 )
 
where η is a (n x 1) vector of deterministic variables, p is the lag length, and ε is a (n x l) vector 
of white noise disturbances, with mean zero and covariance matrix Ξ, and П is a 
(n x n) matrix of coefficients. Express 3 may be reparameterized into the so-called vector error 
correction mechanism (VECM) as: 
 
 t
p
i
titt xxx εη +∏+ΦΔ++=Δ ∑−
=
−−

1  ( 5 )
 
where Δ denotes the first difference operator, Φ is a (n x n) a coefficient matrix ∑
+=
∏−
p
ij
j
1
, and 
П is a (n x n) matrix equal to I
p
i
j −∏−∑
=1
 whose rank determines the number of co-integrating 
vectors. When specified in this VECM form, a vector autoregressive process has the advantage 
of providing information on both the long run relationships among the variables and their short 
run adjustment to such long run equilibrium relationships. 
 
                                                 
12 There are alternative ways of addressing serial correlation and endogeneity in a co-integrating framework, such 
as Phillips and Hansen (1990). 
 
  
48
• If П is of full rank, n, or zero rank, П = 0, no co-integration exists amongst the elements 
in long-run relationship (in these instances it would be appropriate to estimate the 
model in, respectively, levels or first differences). 
•  If, П is of reduced rank, r (where r<n), then there exist (n x r) matrices α and β such that 
П = α β ´, where ß is the matrix whose columns are the linearly independent 
co-integrating vectors, and the α matrix is interpreted as the adjustment matrix, 
indicating the speed with which the system responds to last period's deviations from the 
co-integrating relationships. 
Testing for co-integration therefore requires an estimate of the pie matrix Π = α β′. In the 
Johansen’s approach, this is achieved by estimating the pie matrix Π = α β′ from the 
unrestricted VAR model, and then testing whether the restrictions imposed Π by the reduced 
rank of matrix can be rejected by the data.13 This is tested using two types of tests advocated by 
Johansen. The first is the trace statistic, which allows one to perform a log likelihood ratio (LR) 
test for the null hypothesis that there exist r co-integrating vectors against the alternative of 
co-integrating vectors (where is the number of endogenous variables in the VAR).  
 
The second is the maximum eigenvalue ( max—λ ) statistic. This is a log likelihood test 
that tests the null hypothesis that there is r co-integrating vectors against the alternative 
that there is co-integrating vectors. Asymptotic critical values for conducting these two tests 
have been provided by Johansen (1988), and also Osterwald-Lenum (1992). 
 
An important advantage of the Johansen methodology in the current application is that 
the estimated coefficient—the p vector—can be used to prove a measure of the equilibrium 
real exchange rate and therefore a quantification of the gap between the prevailing real 
exchange rate and its equilibrium level. The methodology also derives estimates of the speed at 
which the real exchange rate converges to the equilibrium level.

IV. Financial Sector Developments in Papua New Guinea1 
A. Introduction 
1.      In recent years, Papua New Guinea’s financial system has experienced rapid 
transformation helped by sustained economic recovery, low interest rates, and high 
commodity prices of key exports. Following a period of severe economic and financial crisis 
in the late 1990s, the authorities began to introduce a significant reform of the financial system 
in 2000, including an increasingly prudent regulatory and supervisory regime, which has 
provided a viable environment for the financial sector to grow. This paper takes a snap shot 
look at the current status of the financial system, including its structure, the regulatory and 
supervisory framework, performance (using CAMEL approach), as well as the constraints and 
risks. In the last section, we conduct stress tests on the banking sector to assess its ability to 
absorb shocks. Finally, we discuss implication of our findings and areas of further reform.  
B. Overview of the Financial Sector and Recent Developments 
2.      Papua New Guinea’s financial sector comprises four commercial banks, a 
number of finance companies, saving and loan institutions, superannuation funds, 
insurance companies, a government bond market and a stock exchange.  
3.      The banking system has four commercial banks (Australia and New Zealand Bank, 
Bank South Pacific, Maybank, and Westpac Bank). The domestic bank (Bank South Pacific) is 
the largest bank accounting for over 50 percent of the banking system. Total assets of the 
banking system have grown from 36 percent of GDP in 2000 to 51 percent of GDP at end-June 
2007. Bank concentration estimated by the Herfindahl index (defined as the sum of squares of 
the shares of banks) shows a figure of over 40 percent having risen from 25 percent in 2000 
following consolidation of the banking system.2 Papua New Guinea’s banks occupy a large 
share of the financial system (70 percent). However, despite the banking sector’s rapid growth 
in recent years, access to financial services remains poor, especially in rural areas. There is also 
a development bank (National Development Bank, formerly the Rural Development Bank) 
that lends with funds provided by the government.

in Port Moresby in November 2007 and benefits from comments received at that time. 
2 Bank South Pacific has about 40 branches in Papua New Guinea (along with a branch in Niue and newly 
acquired banks in Fiji and Solomon Islands). The Australian bank subsidiaries, Australia and New Zealand Bank 
and Westpac Bank, have 9 and 15 branches, respectively, and Maybank, a subsidiary of a Malaysian bank, 
operates 2 branches in Papua New Guinea (see Briggs, 2007). Along with the branches, the number of Automatic 
Teller Machines continues to grow rapidly.

4.      The nonbank sector has grown significantly. The main institutions include ten 
licensed finance companies3 (including microfinance companies) and seven superannuation 
funds.4 The superannuation funds have enjoyed rapid growth following their restructuring in 
the early 2000s. At end-2006, total assets of these funds amounted to K2.8 billion (one fourth 
of total financial sector assets or 16 percent of GDP). The two largest funds, Nambawan Super 
(formerly Public Officers’ Superannuation Fund (POSF)) at 56 percent and Nasfund at 
31 percent share of the total, dominate the superannuation industry with 88,000 and 95,000 
members, respectively. Prior to its reform in the early 2000s, POSF membership was restricted 
to government employees but is now opened to the private sector. There are also a number of 
small saving and loan institutions and insurance companies. 
 
5.      The securities market comprises a large government primary bond market and a 
stock exchange. The government bond market consists of short-term treasury bills and 
longer-term inscribed bonds (18 percent of GDP). Under the new government debt strategy, 
the short term instruments are being replaced by instruments with longer maturities in order to 
deepen the market. These securities are primarily held by commercial banks and other 
nonbanks. The Port Moresby Stock Exchange (POMSoX) is fairly thin having a share listing of 
only 14 companies5 which have relatively high shareholder concentration; however, market 
capitalization has jumped from 52 percent of GDP to almost 130 percent of GDP during 
2002–06, and has continued to rise sharply in 2007 helped by a positive economic environment 
and high profits of mining companies. The corporate bond market is virtually nonexistent.  
                                                 
3 These financial institutions are restricted from issuing checkable deposits. 
4 In a superannuation fund, members’ entitlements are calculated by reference to the amounts standing in the 
members’ individual accounts and not by reference to defined or guaranteed benefits. It provides for compulsory 
savings for retirement through mandatory and/or voluntary contributions by employees and employers. 
5 Of the 14 companies, nine have home listings and five have dual listings. Companies comprise mainly mining 
and financial companies. In addition, there is one company having a debt listing.

6.      Despite rapid growth of the 
banking sector, financial sector depth is 
still low relative to comparator economies. 
While private sector credit growth has been 
high recently in Papua New Guinea, the 
ratio of credit to GDP is still low. To further 
estimate financial deepening, we included a 
sample of comparator Asian economies to 
examine the relationship between the level 
of private sector credit to GDP and its 
change over the last decade. We find that the 
degree of deepening in Papua New Guinea is low relative to comparators (ceteris paribus we 
would expect countries to fall along the negatively sloped line or countries with high level of 
private sector credit to GDP in 1995 to have slower private sector credit growth and vice 
versa). 
  
C. Regulatory and Supervisory Framework 
7.      Beginning in 2000, the authorities undertook a significant revamping of the 
regulatory framework. The current framework now encompasses laws governing the central 
bank, commercial banks and finance institutions, saving and loans, superannuation funds, and 
life insurance companies that were new or reformed at that time. The most recent reform was 
in 2007 relating to the superannuation industry to improve and further strengthen the 
effectiveness of regulations and supervision.6 The financial sector’s regulatory framework is 
transparent and is posted on Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG)’s website. Most institutions 
including the two largest superannuation funds disclose their financial results and are regularly 
audited as required by law. Papua New Guinea does not have an explicit deposit insurance 
                                                 
6 A key change was the requirement for compulsory superannuation coverage for companies to 15 from 
20 employees while the change to also include noncitizens was delayed for a year.

system.7 New legislation has been passed by the parliament governing the newly-revived 
National Development Bank which aims to expand its activities into the microfinance sector 
with deposit-taking and lending to districts. However, the BPNG has not yet issued it a license 
for microfinance. 
8.      The banks’ supervisory framework is fully compliant with the 1988 Basel I Core 
Principles and efforts are being made to follow the Basel II recommendations. The 
outstanding issues are primarily related to capacity building and the establishment of a 
comprehensive bank database. Commercial banks, finance institutions and superannuation 
funds are supervised once a year through on-site examinations. Off site supervision is 
conducted quarterly. Currently, there are plans to extend supervision to all insurance 
companies. 
9.      Plans are underway to introduce a credit registration system for banks. Currently, 
borrower credit information is shared only informally. The International Finance Corporation 
is assisting the BPNG in setting up a credit bureau, which the commercial banks welcome.  
10.      The POMSoX rules and regulations closely follow the Australian stock exchange 
(ASX) model. The stock market regulations are considered to be generally appropriate 
although oversight is being tightened. The 1997 parliamentary passage of the Securities Act 
and Company Act paved the way for establishing the legal framework governing the exchange, 
and in 1998 POMSoX was incorporated as a private company. While there is a concentration 
of large shareholders, small investors are permitted to purchase shares in listed companies.  
11.      The liberalization of the capital account since 2005 has contributed to a conducive 
environment for financial sector growth. A key innovation, since 2005, is the permission to 
allow nonresident companies (notably mining) to borrow from banks. Foreign exchange 
accounts by both residents and nonresidents are permitted. Short-term commercial credits with 
less than one month maturity are not actively regulated. Large financial institutions are taking 
increasing advantage of investment opportunities abroad, although improved domestic 
economic conditions could offset the anticipated outflows. 
D. Performance of the Financial Sector 
Capital Adequacy 
12.      Backward looking indicators of capital adequacy are strong. At end-June 2007, 
commercial banks’ capital to risk weighted assets remained comfortable at 25 percent, against 
the prudential minimum requirement of 12 percent. This is significantly higher than the 
comparator Asian low income and small countries (LISC)8 where the average ratio was 
                                                 
7 Like Papua New Guinea, Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore have implicit deposit insurance; by contrast, 
other neighbors such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand have explicit deposit insurance. 
8 The sample includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Fiji, Kiribati, Lao P.D.R., Maldives, 
  
53
18.3 percent at end-2006, and also higher than selected countries shown in the figure below. At 
the same time, latest data for Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets in the Papua New Guinea 
banking system also shows a comfortable level (16.8 percent in June 2007) against the 
prudential requirement of 8 percent.  
 
Asset Quality 
13.      Commercial banks’ asset quality is reasonably sound. Banks hold about a third of 
their portfolio in government securities, and have a preference for short-term instruments. In 
terms of lending quality, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans declined significantly 
from 16.9 percent to 1.8 percent from 2000 to 2007; comparatively, selected Asian countries 
had higher average ratios, including those that have also seen rapid rates of credit growth in 
recent years. At the same time, both Papua New Guinean banks and finance companies have 
maintained high provisioning ratios of loans losses relative to their NPLs. 
14.      Personal and commerce sectors comprise an important share of bank credit, 
while building and construction, and transport and communication have grown. 
Outstanding advances to mining and quarrying had also grown significantly over the past year 
(likely associated with the 2005 liberalization of lending to nonresident companies and

15.      While asset quality in terms of total assets is generally not yet of concern, certain 
underlying trends over the past year could be noted which may stretch supervisory 
capacity. Banks’ zero risk assets to total risk-weighted assets fell from 53 percent to 
48 percent in June 2007 (y/y), while the share of 50 percent risk-weighted assets rose from 
4 percent to 13 percent. Also, the stock of NPLs and past due loans have started to rise from 
negative growth in past years, although they are stable in relation to total loans. The NPLs of 
the National Development Bank have been reported to be around 100 percent on “old” and 
20 percent on “new” loans.  
16.      At the same time, the overall banking system’s large borrower exposure is 
considered high. In particular, the exposure of the 25 largest borrowers against banking 
system’s total prudential capital base was about 100 percent in June 2007, although individual 
borrower exposures have not been high.  
17.      The rapid expansion of the superannuation funds so far does not seem to have an 
adverse effect on asset quality. While Nasfund and Nambawan Super have invested in the 
domestic equity and property markets, they have also expanded overseas investments to 
diversify their portfolio and now earn higher returns in both fixed income assets as well as 
equities (total international investments for the two funds accounted for 23.0 percent and 
17.4 percent, respectively in 2006). Over the past few years, both funds have also enjoyed 
rapid asset growth.

Management Quality and Conduct  
18.      The return on assets, which measures the ability of management to utilize real 
and financial resources of a bank to 
generate returns, rose from 1.2 percent to 
2.8 percent during 2000–07. The figure 
here shows Papua New Guinea’s return on 
assets relative to comparator Asian countries. 
Management accountability in key financial 
institutions is evidenced by the regular 
publication of financial reports and 
company information posted on their 
respective websites for the benefit of 
shareholders and customers. 
Interest Rate Structure and Earnings Performance  
19.      Interest rate spreads (lending minus deposit rates) have declined in recent years 
(see figures below). Spreads were as high as 11 percent before easing to a still high 9.6 percent 
in 2006, likely reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty, high administrative costs of banks in 
rural areas, limited bank competition, and low incentive to attract deposits given banks’ 
relative preference to hold government paper in light of limited investment opportunities. 
While Papua New Guinea’s nominal lending rates in 2006 (10.6 percent) were lower than the 
LISC average (14.0 percent), real lending rates were comparable (7.0 percent). In comparison 
to U.S., Australia, and Indonesia, real lending rates are higher in Papua New Guinea, although 
they have declined over the years in part due to lower inflation. 
 
20.      Both banks and superannuation funds have enjoyed high profitability in recent 
years. As the return on assets rose, the return on equity also increased from 21.7 percent to 
38.9 percent over the same period. By contrast, low income and small Asian countries on 
average show an equivalent return on assets (3.0 percent), but a lower return on equity

(29.5 percent) as of 2006. The largest superannuation funds, Nambawan Super and Nasfund, 
enjoyed high net after tax return (16 and 10 percent, respectively in 2006).  
Liquidity  
21.      Liquidity in the financial system is high, constituting large holdings of 
government paper. Commercial banks’ liquidity (average liquid assets to total deposits) rose 
from 54 percent in 2002 to around 75 percent in 2007—significantly higher than the average 
for low income and small Asian countries (27 percent). 
Efficiency 
22.      Banks have been generating strong profits and dividends resulting from a 
favorable economic environment and high commodity prices, but also due to their ability 
to control expenses. The “efficiency ratio” measured by noninterest expenses to gross income 
is around 40 percent and average gross income per employee (K274,000) for the banking 
system is significantly greater than per employee costs (K41,000). 
 
23.      The thin securities markets limit financial deepening. Stock market capitalization 
(at over 100 percent of GDP) is amongst the highest as compared to the group of low income

and small Asian countries (15 percent of GDP), helped by dual listing of several companies on 
both the Papua New Guinea and foreign stock exchanges (mainly Australia). However, at the 
same time, comparatively, there are fewer companies and the annual market turnover is 
relatively low (0.5 percent of GDP vs. 1.6 percent of GDP for sample of LISC countries). At 
present, there are only two brokers and relatively high shareholder concentration. The thin 
stock exchange potentially could limit the ability of firms (especially in the nonmineral sector) 
to secure equity financing, hence further increasing their reliance on banks. As regards other 
markets, there is only a primary government securities market with financial institutions 
holding about 85 percent of these securities.  
E. Constraints, Vulnerabilities, and Risks 
24.      Papua New Guinea ranks relatively low in a global ranking of “getting credit” 
(115 out of 175 countries), according to the latest World Bank’s Doing Business survey. 
Focusing on the sub-categories, the “legal rights” index performs equally well relative to the 
region, while given an absence of a credit registry in Papua New Guinea, the “credit 
information index” (representing the access and quality of credit information available through 
public registries or private bureaus) receives a 0 rating out of a possible 6 (with a 2 rating for 
South Asia and East Asia/Pacific region). At the same time, Papua New Guinea also ranks 
relatively low in the categories of “enforcing contracts” (162) and “closing a business” (97).

25.      The scope for financial deepening is also constrained by weak corporate 
insolvency and debt recovery procedures (see Appendix Table I, lines 1–20).9 These 
procedures include formal and informal rules for enforcement of debt contracts, bankruptcy 
liquidation, and the rehabilitation of distressed firms. We note that while the procedures for 
acquiring collateral are comparable to sample countries, the process of collateral enforcement 
is weaker. More generally, a high degree of communal land ownership (about 97 percent of all 
land) and less liquid asset markets could be constraining the ability of lending institutions to 
secure and especially enforce collateral requirements. Given weaknesses in formal debt 
recovery procedures, informal procedures could be preferred (e.g., lines 11–14). More 
positively, the judicial processes for debt recovery (lines 17–20) appear to be relatively more 
efficient in Papua New Guinea compared with most sample countries including Bangladesh 
and Indonesia. 
                                                 
9 We obtained an assessment of processes for debt recovery from a banking expert in Papua New Guinea during 
the 2007 Article IV mission. The table compares Papua New Guinea with several low and middle income 
countries in the region reported in previous studies (Hussain and Wihlborg, 1999 and Hussain, 2002). The country 
wide comparisons should be treated with caution since we used different time periods, and procedures would be 
expected to improve over time. Also, there is a risk that each individual country survey could employ a different 
“scale” for evaluation.

Stress Tests for Papua New Guinea Banking System 
 
26.      In order to examine the vulnerability of the banking sector, stress tests were 
performed.10 Our analysis uses the 2006 audited annual reports of the four commercial banks 
as well as end-2006 banks’ financial statements provided by BPNG. The sensitivity analysis 
replicates plausible scenarios from the late 1990s economic and financial crisis in Papua New 
Guinea as well as aspects of the 1997 Asian crisis that include a rise in the share of 
nonperforming loans to total loans to 15–20 percent and a near doubling of interest rates. 
Looking forward, these events could arise in an environment of weak domestic policies and 
                                                 
10 The stress tests reported for the Papua New Guinea banking system in this sub-section were performed 
using templates accompanying the “Stress Test Toolkit” prepared by Plamen Iossifov (IMF), 2007. 
Box. What are Stress Tests? 
Stress tests are analytical techniques for quantifying the vulnerability of banks’ portfolio to exceptional 
but plausible changes in the macro environment.1 Under the stress tests, the effect of shocks on banks’ 
soundness is measured by their impact on banks’ regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets.  
Credit risk stress tests quantify the effect on banks’ soundness of deterioration in the average asset quality 
of their portfolios. The deterioration of asset quality has both a repricing and a net income effect on banks’ 
regulatory capital. The following credit risk tests were applied:  
(i) Increase in nonperforming loans: the nonperforming loans approach involves reclassification of 
existing current loans to nonperforming, with corresponding increases in the level of specific provisions 
and a decrease in the level of general provisions;  
(ii) Large exposures to borrowers: the stress test on banks’ large exposures to borrowers is a specific 
parameterization of the credit risk stress test based on the nonperforming loans approach. It involves the 
reclassification of all loans to each bank’s largest borrowers (assumed to be current prior to the stress test) 
to nonperforming, with corresponding increases in the level of specific provisions and a decrease in the 
level of general provisions; and  
(iii) Increased provisioning approach on existing NPLs: the provisioning approach involves the 
reclassification of existing nonperforming loans into categories indicating a higher degree of impairment. 
A corresponding increase in the level of specific provisions would need to be set aside by banks to cover 
the upwardly revised expectations of losses.  
Finally, we also performed a test for migration of risk-weighted assets from low risk to high-risk weights. 
Interest rate risk is estimated using the duration model, which measures the impact of interest rate 
changes only on the price of securities held by banks. Duration can be defined as the weighted-average of 
time to maturity, using the present value of cash flows as weights. In Papua New Guinea, banks hold 
government securities only sold in the primary market.

rapid decline in commodity prices. The main focus of the analysis is on (i) credit and borrower 
concentration risk; (ii) risk arising from migration of assets from low to high risk-weight 
groups; and (iii) interest rate risk. Foreign exchange risk is not analyzed since we do not have 
sufficient individual bank data on foreign exchange (FX) assets and FX liabilities. From the 
aggregate data that is available on banks, it appears that the risk is not high at present (FX 
deposits comprise only 8–10 percent of total deposits and FX loans constitute around 
6–10 percent of total loans). Moreover, liquidity risk does not seem to be a concern at present 
since the liquid assets to total deposits were 76 percent in 2006.  
27.      Individual stress test analysis shows that the banking system is resilient to 
moderate shocks:11  
• Starting with baseline capital asset ratio of 24.8 percent (regulatory minimum is 12 
percent), the reclassification of existing NPLs indicating a higher degree of impairment 
for each NPL category12 (i.e., 33 percent in each category) only shows a marginal 
decline in the capital asset ratio.  
• The capital asset ratio falls to 22.1 percent under the condition that all existing NPLs 
shift from substandard to bad.  
• While the current NPLs to total loans is low at the present time, the deterioration of 
loans so that 15 percent of current loans become substandard NPLs reduces the capital 
to risk weighted assets ratio to 22.2 percent. This scenario is similar to the events that 
marked the 1997 Asian crisis (see Hussain and Wihlborg, 1999) and the late 1990s 
Papua New Guinea crisis.  
• The interest rate risk test (duration test) for a doubling of interest rates (as in the Papua 
New Guinea crisis) reduces the ratio to 20.4 percent.  
• The stress tests indicate that the risk from large borrower exposure is high. The loss of 
the single largest borrower of each bank reduces capital adequacy ratios to 
18.3 percent.  
• The test for migration of assets from low to high risk weights (by 25 percent) reduces 
the capital asset ratio to 17.7 percent.  
• In the case that 15 percent of current loans become “loss” or bad loans (delinquent for 
more than 360 days), the capital asset ratio declines to 14.6 percent.  
                                                 
11 The discussion for individual stress tests in this paragraph corresponds to declining capital assets ratios in the 
figure below (from left to right). 
12 According to Papua New Guinea’s prudential standards, loans are classified as (i) pass, or acceptable; 
(ii) special mention (past due for 60–90 days); (iii) substandard (past due for 90–180 days); (iv) doubtful (past due 
for 180–360 days); and (v) loss (past due for more than 360 days). 
  
61
• An extreme crisis scenario involving the loss of each bank’s five largest borrowers 
almost exhausts the capital of the banking system.  
 
28.      The integrated approach using a “scenario” analysis combining some of the 
above individual tests shows a greater degree of vulnerability in the banking system. We 
examined two combined shock scenarios (see figure above):  
• Combined shocks 1: 15 percent of current loans become substandard, doubling of 
interest rates, and migration of assets from low to high risk weights (by 25 percent) 
reduces the capital adequacy ratio to 12.4 percent (to the required regulatory 
minimum); and  
• Combined shocks 2: loss of the largest borrower, doubling of interest rates, and 
migration of assets from low to high risk weights (by 25 percent) leads to a 
deterioration of capital adequacy ratio to 9.4 percent (below the required regulatory 
minimum). Although not included in the figure, the most extreme scenario, which 
involves the loss of the five largest borrowers in each bank, along with the interest rate 
and migration risk, completely exhausts the banking system capital. 
F. Conclusions and Implications  
29.      The backward looking soundness indicators show that the financial system is 
sound. However, stress test analysis finds that while the system can absorb moderate shocks, a 
combination of shocks brought about by weak macro policies and an unfavorable external 
environment (with declining commodity prices) could add significant vulnerability. Our 
examination of the financial system illustrates that financial deepening is still low despite high

credit growth in recent years. Looking forward, continued high credit growth and growing 
international investment opportunities for financial institutions requires that these institutions 
strengthen their internal risk management systems in addition to improved supervision by the 
authorities. In this regard, the authorities are appropriately considering the establishment of a 
credit bureau. The authorities should also ensure that due diligence and fit and proper criteria 
are applied for all new applicants for licenses, including for the Development Bank. Moreover, 
prudent macroeconomic policies are the only means of averting financial crisis given past 
experiences of Papua New Guinea and other countries. In order to enhance financial deepening, 
the authorities should reduce structural rigidities in the system, including improved rules for 
collateral and procedures for insolvency and debt recovery, and further develop the securities 
markets. In this regard, a Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted jointly by 
the IMF and World Bank could be useful to provide an assessment of recent developments and 
recommendations for the way forward.

V. Tax Summary 20081 
A. Direct Taxation 
Taxation of Individuals 
1.      The tax year coincides with the calendar year. Residence is defined as physical 
presence in Papua New Guinea (PNG) for more than six months out of a given tax year. 
Resident individuals are taxed on global income from all sources, subject to double-taxation 
treaties. Nonresident individuals are liable for tax only on income derived from PNG sources. 
The maximum number of dependents for whom a tax rebate may be claimed was reduced from 
four to three in the 2004 Budget. 
2.      There are two separate types of assessment: (i) a fortnightly salary or wages tax 
assessment; and (ii) an annual non-salary or wages income assessment. Expenses of earning 
income are fully deductible, and there are no capital gains or gift taxes. The tax rates on 
assessed income are shown in Table IV.1.

Above K250,000 42 
Taxation of Companies 
3.      Tax years generally correspond to calendar years, unless there is a sufficient 
reason to deviate from that rule (e.g., if the parent company has a different tax year). A 
company is considered resident for tax purposes if it is incorporated in PNG, has its 
management in PNG, or is controlled by PNG residents. A resident company is taxed on its 
global income from all sources. Nonresident companies pay tax only on PNG sourced income. 
4.      The general company tax rate is 30 percent, except for authorized 
superannuation funds, for which the applicable rate is 25 percent. Taxable income generally 
corresponds to accounting income. Company income tax is payable as advanced payment tax 
(APT), so that companies pay tax on the current year’s income. Advanced payment tax is 
payable in three equal installments on the last business day of April, July, and October each 
year. Business losses can be carried over for up to 20 years; they cannot be carried back.

information see the Internal Revenue Commission website: http://www.irc.gov.pg/index.htm

5.      Special Temporary Rates for Agriculture and Tourism apply. The 2004 Budget 
introduced a 20 percent tax rate would apply for 10 years to agricultural projects with an 
investment of K5 million or more commencing between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 
2006. The 2006 Budget extended the eligibility period for this temporary concessional tax rate 
from 31 December 2006 to 31 December 2011. The 2006 Budget also reduced the amount 
needed to be invested to qualify from K5 million to K1 million. The 2007 Budget introduced a 
temporary concessional tax rate of 20 percent for 10 years from the date of operation and the 
availability of infrastructure tax credits for an indefinite period but limited in amount to 1.5 
percent of gross income in each year and to the income tax liability for large scale tourist 
accommodation facilities involving investment of US $10 million or more where construction 
commences within five years from 1 January 2007 and the resulting facility has at least 150 
guest rooms. 
6.      Other assistance measures for tourism and agriculture have been introduced 
since 2005, including a double deduction for export market development costs for tourism 
operators and accelerated depreciation for capital expenditure. These concessions were 
expanded in 2007. A double deduction for staff training costs was introduced. The depreciation 
allowable for the first year was increased to 55 percent in 2007. The purchase by foreign 
tourists of travel and accommodation in PNG while outside the country will be exempt from 
GST from 1 January 2007. A 150 percent tax deduction for research and development and 
agricultural extension services, was introduced in the 2004 Budget. The level of infrastructure 
tax credits available to agriculture was increased from 0.5 percent of assessable income to 0.75 
percent of assessable income in 2005. This was further increased to 1.5 percent of assessable 
income in 2006. 
7.      Dividend withholding tax of 17 percent is applicable to all dividends paid by resident 
companies and received by resident companies from sources outside of Papua New Guinea. 
Dividend withholding tax on dividends paid to nonresidents, resident individuals and resident 
trust estate is a final tax. While the standard rate of dividend withholding tax on dividends paid 
to nonresidents is 17 percent, under some of PNG’s bilateral double tax treaties, a lower rate is 
prescribed. A DWT of 10 percent applies to dividends from mining companies. Dividends 
from petroleum and gas operations are not subject to DWT. 
8.      Interest withholding tax of 15 percent was introduced in 1999. Interest withholding 
tax on interest paid to nonresidents is a final tax. Interest paid by mining and petroleum 
companies to nonresident financial institutions is exempt. 
Taxation of Mining and Petroleum Companies 
9.      Mining and petroleum companies are subject to different rates of taxation than 
non-resource companies as summarized in Table IV.2. Corporate income tax for mining 
companies is payable as APT, as for non-resource companies. At the beginning of each year, 
the Internal Revenue Commission (IRC) assesses the APT estimate lodged by the tax payer 
and issues an APT assessment to the mining company. The company then pays this assessment 
 68 
 
(in Kina) to the BPNG account at the Federal Reserve Bank in New York in three equal 
installments in April, July, and October. Any differences between the APT assessment and 
final income tax assessment (also known as wash-up) for mining companies are requested to 
be paid in U.S. dollars. The payment mechanism of corporate income tax for petroleum 
companies is same as for mining companies, except that APT lodgment, assessment and 
payment are all made in U.S. dollars. Any differences between the APT assessment and final 
income tax assessment or “wash-up” for petroleum companies are requested to be paid in 
U.S. dollars. 
10.      Business losses can be carried over indefinitely.

Other Provisions for the Mining and Petroleum Sectors 
11.      A mining levy was introduced in July 1999 to capture the windfall gain of the 
mining industry from the introduction of the VAT, which resulted from the zero-rating of 
their exports in conjunction with the removal of the 11 percent basic import duty for all sectors 
of the economy. In 2002 the government commenced phasing out the mining levy over a 
 69 
 
four-year period, intending to reduce it by one-fourth of the original amount every year. 
However, phase out of the mining levy was temporarily suspended in 2003. In 2004 the 
government reinstituted the phase out at the rate of 5 percentage points, and an additional 
5 percentage points per annum every year thereafter, with the phase out to be complete by 2008. 
However, some payments for previous years assessments are expected to be received in 2008. 
12.      To promote new petroleum projects, the rate of corporate income tax was 
reduced from 50 percent to 45 percent and then effectively to 30 percent for petroleum 
projects. The reduced rate does not apply to projects that existed at the time of reduction in 
January 2001. The government has also introduced special fiscal incentives for Petroleum 
Prospecting Licenses issued before January 1, 2008, which convert to Petroleum Development 
Licenses before January 1, 2018. This practically entitles all petroleum projects that 
commence operation between 2003–17 to a reduced petroleum corporate tax rate of 30 percent 
for the life of the project. The reduced corporate income tax rate is aimed at providing 
incentives for new petroleum exploration.  
13.      Additional profit taxes, which were applied to mining and petroleum company 
income that exceeded an internal rate of return of at least 20 percent, have been abolished for 
mining and petroleum projects but not gas ones such as the prospective Gas to Australia 
project. 
14.      A national resource tax is imposed by the national government but paid to 
provincial governments and landowners as a royalty of 2 percent of the net value of output 
from mining, petroleum and gas projects.  
15.      Resource companies are allowed a full credit for the cost of approved 
infrastructure developments that they undertake for the benefit of communities. This 
Infrastructure Tax Credit (ITC) applies to the region in which they operate or elsewhere. The 
deduction is limited to the lesser of 0.75 percent (reduced from 2 percent from Jan 2001) of 
assessable income or tax payable for the year. 
Taxation of Superannuation Funds 
16.      All companies employing 20 or more persons are required to provide 
superannuation for their employees. Employee contributions are deducted from gross basic 
salary at a minimum rate of 5 percent, while the employer contributes 7 percent of the 
employees’ gross salary. Civil servants contribute to the Public Officers Superannuation Fund, 
where contribution rates of 6 percent for the employee and 8.4 percent for the employer apply.  
17.      Superannuation funds are subject to income tax. The corporate income tax rate for 
authorized superannuation funds was reduced from 30 percent to 25 percent in 2004. This is 
expected to increase domestic savings, and boost member returns and benefits over time. To 
further encourage savings, the government also introduced concessional taxation arrangements 
in 2004, allowing the retention of funds in the newly established Retirement Savings Accounts 
 70 
 
(RSAs) up to a maximum of K 100,000. Under the new arrangement, employees exiting a 
superannuation fund can voluntarily transfer their savings to RSAs. These savings can be 
drawn down on a periodic basis free of income tax, providing an income stream in retirement. 
Draw-down rules limit the rate at which monies can be withdrawn in order to protect savings 
from dissipation. The earnings of RSAs are also free from income tax, subject to the maximum 
draw-down rules. 
18.      The 2004 Budget also introduced concessional tax rates for employer 
contributions and fund earnings at the benefit stage in accordance with Table IV.3. 
Previously, only employees who have been with a fund for more than 15 years benefited from 
the concessional tax rate of 2 percent.

B. Indirect Taxation 
Goods and Services Tax  
19.      The goods and services tax (GST) has a uniform tax rate of 10 percent on the 
price of goods sold by a business, with zero-rated exports, including for the mining and 
petroleum sectors. Exempted goods and services are mainly medical services, financial 
services, education services and supplies, fine metals and public transportation fees. GST is 
levied on all imported goods, with the exception of imports by aid donors and diplomatic 
missions and for the mining and petroleum sectors. All businesses with an expected turnover in 
excess of K 100,000 must register for GST. Registration for other businesses is voluntary.  
20.      From 2004, inland GST collections (net of refunds) are distributed between 
national government and provinces on the basis of 40 percent to the national government 
and 60 percent to provincial governments.2 Each provincial share of the net inland 
collection is calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the GST Revenue 
Distribution Act. Up until 31 December 2006 these distributions were based on an estimate of 
the revenue to be received in the year. For 2007 and future years the distribution will be based 
on the actual net revenue received two years previously, provided the distribution is no less 
than the actual distribution to a province in 2006. 
                                                 
2 Except for Bougainville where the distribution is on the basis of 70 percent to the national government and 
30 percent to the province. 
 71 
 
Excise Taxes 
21.      Excise taxes are applied to alcoholic beverages (beer, wine, and spirits), cigarettes, 
other manufactured tobacco products, and fuels. Since the 1999 tax and tariff reform, 
excise taxes also apply to a few products that were previously protected by high tariffs, such as 
motor vehicles and audio-visual electronic equipment. The excise rates for alcohol and tobacco 
products were indexed by 4 percent every six months from May 1, 2003. However, the 2004 
Budget froze the indexation for 12 months until November 31, 2004. From December 1, 2004, 
the excise indexation for alcohol and tobacco products resumed at 2.5 percent. From 
December 1, 2005, the excise indexation for alcohol and tobacco products became the lesser of 
2.5 percent or the increase in the Consumer Price Index every six months, with the rates 
applying from December 1st 2008 shown in Table IV.4. 
22.      From the beginning of 2004, an excise duty exemption was granted to business 
and individual importing tractors for use in agricultural and forestry work as well as 
pedestrian controlled tractors. The excise rate was reduced from 10 percent to 0 percent.

Import Duties 
23.      The Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS Tariff) was 
adopted in January 1991. The tariff classifications will be revised in 2008 to reflect the latest 
international standards. Papua New Guinea became a member of the World Customs 
Organization in 1998, and is implementing the WTO agreement on Customs Valuations. 
Papua New Guinea bound its entire tariff schedule during the Uruguay Round. A seven-year 
tariff reform program (TRP) commenced in July 1999, rationalizing the tariff structure and 
setting a schedule for the phased reductions of tariffs. Under the TRP, tariff rates were reduced 
to the current rates of 15, 25, and 40 percent in January 2006. A review of the TRP was 
concluded in 2007 and recommendations will be considered for implementation in the 2009 
budget. Domestic sugar production is protected with a specific 70 percent tariff, which will be 
maintained until the end of 2010 while domestic canned mackerel production is protected with 
a specific 20 percent tariff, which will be maintained until the end of 2010. 
24.      Preferential import tariff arrangements exist with members of the Melanesian 
Spearhead Group, and a bilateral arrangement with Fiji.  
Table IV.5. Tariff Rates (in percent)

Basic rate  Abolished  11 
Intermediate rate  15  40 
Protective rate  25  55 
Prohibitive rate  40  75–125 
 
The descriptions of the tariff categories are as follows: 
 
• Duty free items: more than three-fourths of all lines fall into this category. 
• Intermediate rate items: intermediate goods. 
• Protective rate items: goods that are produced, or potentially can be produced, in Papua 
New Guinea and are seen as requiring a level of protection. 
• Prohibitive rate items: these include fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts (whether or not 
preserved), beer, cigarettes and cigars, veneer and plywood, articles of jewelry and pearls, 
prefabricated buildings and sugar. Tariffs for some of these products (plywood, and veneer 
sheets) will be higher than the prohibitive rate during the phased reduction, but set at the 
general prohibitive rate in 2006. There is a specific tariff on beer, spirits, cigarettes, 
matches, shelled birds’ eggs and certain tobacco products. 
 73 
 
Import Levy 
25.      In 2004, a temporary levy of 2.0 percent was imposed on imports, except imports 
by the mining and petroleum sectors, by churches and charitable groups, and pharmaceuticals 
and medical goods. The levy was operative until December 31, 2004 only. 
Export Duties 
26.      Export duties are levied only on unprocessed logs, sandalwood, crocodile skins 
and mineral ores; the duty varies depending on the product. Export duties are calculated on an 
f.o.b. basis and are payable before shipment. A pre-shipment inspection system on the export 
of round logs has been supplied by a private contractor since late 1994. Up until 31 December 
2006 the log export duty was imposed on a progressive rate scale. A new forestry revenue 
sharing arrangement was introduced in 2007, which lowered the export duty on logs from 35 
percent to 28.5 percent. Landowners are intended to benefit from this change as the export tax 
reduction is designed to be offset by the payment of an export development levy of K8 per 
cubic meter. Plantation logs are exempt from export duty. Crocodile skins are charged an 
export tax set at 5 percent, and sandalwood is charged at a rate of 15 percent.  
C. Other Taxes 
27.      Gaming machine tax (Tax on Pokies) was introduced in October 1996 as a general 
revenue measure, and last increased by the Gaming Machine (Amendment) Act of 2002. In 
May 2007, the new Gaming Control Act amended the distribution of the turnover of gaming 
machines to all stakeholders as shown in Table IV.6.

28.      The 2008 budget abolished stamp duty on a number of items. Stamp duties are 
imposed by the national government on the execution of certain documents. The rates vary by 
type of document. Stamp duty is abolished on the following items from January 1, 2008: loan 
agreements or contracts; loan securities, mortgages and foreign securities, hire and credit 
 74 
 
purchase agreements; bills of lading; and certificates of incorporation. Stamp duty on 
insurance contracts and debits tax will also be abolished from April 1, 2008.3  
29.      Departure tax of K 30 is payable by all persons departing Papua New Guinea. 
Departing international passengers also pay a K 30 terminal facility charge to the Civil 
Aviation Authority. 
30.      Land tax may be imposed by provincial governments although this tax is difficult to 
implement and collect. 
D. Tax Concessions and incentives 
31.      To encourage investment a number of tax concessions are offered. Sector specific 
concessions in the agriculture, forestry, fisheries, manufacturing, petroleum, and mining 
sectors are noted above. In addition, and to try to avoid previous practices where ad hoc 
concessions were granted in particular project agreements, generally applicable tax 
concessions have been introduced. These include: 
• A research and development incentive, where a 150 percent income tax deduction is 
allowed for expenditure on research and development; 
• A double deduction for staff training costs, which allows a double deduction against 
company income tax for the payment of salaries and wages of registered apprentices or 
other employees attending full-time training at a Government training institute or 
prescribed tertiary institution; 
• A duty drawback, which is a rebate paid to exporting manufacturers when they export 
goods equal to the amount of duty already paid on new materials; 
• An export sales exemption, which exempts profits from export sales for the first three 
years and income from increases in exports for the following four years; and 
• Accelerated and flexible depreciation, which allows for capital assets to be written off 
at a faster rate than their effective lives. New industrial plant is eligible for increased 
depreciation up to 100 percent of cost. The taxpayer may elect the amount to be 
claimed in any year, but not so as to create a loss. To qualify, the plant must have a life 
exceeding five years, and can be used by the taxpayer or any other person. 
32.      The Government has over successive budgets estimated and reported on the size of its 
tax concessions. Table IV.7 shows the estimated size of the tax concessions for the past five 
years. Details of the amounts forgone are set out in budget documents. 
                                                 
3 The debit tax was introduced during 2003, and applied to withdrawals of K50 and over from financial 
institutions.
