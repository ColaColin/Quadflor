INCOME TAXATION, TUITION SUBSIDIES, AND 
CHOICE OF OCCUPATION: IMPLICATIONS 
FOR PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY 
 
 
Abstract 
 
The desirability for production efficiency is re-examined in this study, where agents choose 
occupation based on lifetime income net of tuition costs. Efficient revenue raising implies that 
the government should trade off efficiency in production for efficiency in intertemporal 
consumption, as capital income is taxed in optimum. The subsequent wage difference 
between high- and low-skilled occupations is increased compared to a production efficient 
outcome, which is in contrast to previous results in the literature.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The last few years, the empirical basis for some of the assumptions behind the production efficiency 
theorem of Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) has been questioned. The theorem states that the economy 
should be on its production frontier at the optimum when the government can tax all factors at 
different rates. The deduction of this result was, however, based on the following questionable 
assumptions: The first is that labor skill types are assumed to be perfect substitutes in production. The 
factor price equalization theorem (the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem) supports this assumption. However, 
Katz and Autor (1999) find that the wage differences between occupations to a large extent are driven 
by local demand and supply factors. The second is that skill-specific tax rates are feasible and that the 
government can observe individual-specific features. However, obtaining this information might be 
costly. In fact, most tax systems rely on more aggregate variables like e.g. income. One particular 
question raised is whether it can be optimal to design the tax system to compress the pre-tax wage gap 
between high and low-skilled occupations at the expense of efficiency in production. New insight was 
gained when these two questionable assumptions where relaxed. Naito (1999) shows that the Diamond 
and Mirrlees (1971) production efficiency theorem brakes down when labor skill types are imperfect 
substitutes in production, skill-specific taxation is excluded, and a fixed allocation of individuals in 
each occupation responds to incentives by varying hours of work. In this setting, indirect taxation 
aimed at compressing the wage rates can increase welfare even in the presence of a non-linear income 
tax. The intuition is that the wage compression generates skill-specific redistribution of income, which 
represents a more efficient way to redistribute income, while the subsequent inefficiency in production 
generates a marginal cost when distortions are small. However, Naito?s assumption of given skills can 
be put under question. Saez (2004) restores the production efficiency theorem when he lets individuals 
choose occupation freely based on after-tax income. A policy that increases the low-skilled wage rate 
relative to the high-skilled would only result in more individuals choosing the low-skilled occupation. 
Hence, such policy does not redistribute income more efficiently than a non-linear income tax.   
3 
 In this analysis, I take into account that agents tend to choose occupation based on costs and benefits 
over a lifetime, and not just after-tax income. Within such a setting the government needs to determine 
a set of policy parameters likely to influence the choice of occupation, and hence, the optimal design 
of the tax system. Tuition subsidies affect the amount of tuition costs paid by individuals, labor 
income taxation affect the wage premium of choosing a high-skilled occupation, and capital income 
taxation affect the return on financial saving, which differ across occupations. The choice of 
occupation is closely linked to the choice of education, and these policy parameters are found to be 
crucial in the literature on optimal taxation and choice of education (see e.g. Bovenberg and Jacobs 
(2005), Nilsen and S?rensen (1997), and Nerlove et al. (1993)). Unfortunately, this literature does not 
consider implications for the pre-tax wage compression, as skill types are prefect substitutes in 
production within these studies.  
 
This paper presents a new general equilibrium model on optimal taxation and choice of occupation 
that incorporates these policy instruments1. I specifically explore taxation of labor income, capital 
income, and tuition costs, all being policy-relevant instruments used in most countries. The allocation 
of individuals between occupations is determined in equilibrium by a non-arbitrage condition where 
(expected) present value lifetime income net of taxes and tuition costs is equal between occupations. 
The occupation-specific wage rates are adjusted endogenously to this condition. The main finding is 
that a production-efficient allocation of skill types is undesirable on pure efficiency grounds. In fact, 
efficient revenue raising to finance government consumption implies that the high-skilled wage rate 
should be increased relative to a production-efficient outcome of wage rates. These conclusions are 
opposite to those in Saez (2004) and Naito (1999) respectively.   
 
                                                     
1 This model is based on the model used in Bjertn?s (2001). 
4 
The intuition for this result is found by considering how taxation affects the costs and gains of 
occupational choices. The gain of choosing a high-skilled occupation consists of a higher wage 
income, while the cost consists of higher tuition payments. A uniform tuition subsidy rate equal to a 
(proportional) tax rate on labor income implies no distortion in choice of occupation, as both costs and 
gains are reduced by the same factor. However, a lower tuition subsidy rate generates a more modest 
need for revenue to finance these subsidies. As the tuition subsidy rate is set lower than the labor 
income tax rate to reduce the tax financing cost, the incentive to choose the high-skilled occupations is 
reduced. A tax on capital income contributes to reverse this distortion, as choosing high-skilled 
occupations implies less financial saving. However, the distortion in choice of occupation should not 
be completely neutralized, as the government is forced to trade off the distortion in choice of 
occupation against a distortion in intertemporal consumption created by the tax on capital income. 
Consequently, efficient revenue raising implies a lower (higher) supply of high (low) skilled labor 
compared to the production efficient allocation, which also imply a higher (lower) wage rate for high 
(low) skilled labor. 
 
This result is important because of its implications for the design of the tax system, and the subsequent 
argument against wage compression. The paper also shows that the production-efficient allocation of 
skills requires a specific design of the income tax system. This is important because such conditions 
for production efficiency have not been considered in the literature on optimal taxation. For example, 
a pure non-linear labor income tax system is said to be production efficient. However, skill formation 
is likely to be affected when individuals choose occupation based on lifetime income. Hence, further 
study is needed within this field of research.  
 
Section 2 states the general assumptions. Section 3 elaborates on the market solution, while efficient 
taxation is analyzed in section 4 and 5. Section 6 concludes and suggests some extensions for further 
research.

2. GENERAL ASSUMPTIONS 
Consider a small, open economy taking the interest rate in the rest of the world as given. The economy 
produces one tradable good, which is either invested or consumed. The price is set to unity. Labor is 
internationally immobile. Individuals live for two periods. At the beginning of the first period, 
individuals choose a high-skill or a low-skill occupation. Individuals supply given amounts of their 
type of skill in the labor market in the second period of life. These types of skill are imperfect 
substitutes in production.  
 
The following notation is followed throughout the paper. 
occupation
timeperiodn  
Superscript denotes type of occupation (low-skill = 1, high-skill = 2) for variable  (= number of 
individuals). Subscript indicates time period. Superscript will be ignored for variables not 
characterized by skill type. Subscripts will be skipped for variables that are not characterized by either 
age or time of involvement in the market.   
n
 
The supply of labor effort is normalized so that individuals in occupation i supply one unit of their 
skill type in the second period. The education required for each occupation involves resources.  
denotes the amount of resources needed per student in occupation i. The high-skilled occupation is 
assumed to require more resources per student than the low-skilled occupation, i.e. .

3. THE MARKET SOLUTION 
In the market solution there is free competition in all markets. Individuals can lend and borrow freely 
at the given interest rate, r . Tax and subsidy changes are introduced in the beginning of the first 
period in the model. The public sector collects taxes to finance public consumption, G, and tuition 
subsidies. When tax on capital income is introduced, individuals are taxed with the same rate on 
foreign and domestic-source income. A non-arbitrage condition for investments implies that the pre-
tax return on domestic investment equals the interest rate abroad. The wage rates between occupations 
are determined by a non-arbitrage condition for choice of education  
3.1 INDIVIDUALS  
Individuals are endowed with the same initial abilities, and maximize an identical Cobb-Douglas 
utility function2 w.r.t. first and second period consumption, constrained by the present value of 
consumption being equal to their present value of lifetime income.   
max                                                                                                                                   (3) )1(21

Where r?  is the capital income tax rate, ?  is the labor income tax rate, s is the tuition subsidy rate, 
and  is the occupation specific wage rate. The relative price between first and second period 
consumption is determined by capital income taxation and the given interest rate. A zero tax rate on 
capital income implies that the rate of substitution between first and second period consumption equals 
the rate of transformation. Hence, the distortion in intertemporal consumption is completely removed.

Present value lifetime income consists of the discounted second period wage income, minus tuition

 Individuals are assumed to choose occupation to maximize their expected lifetime income. In a market 
olution where the population is divided between both occupations, the expected wage rates have to s
adjust so that expected lifetime income net of taxes and tuition costs is equal in both occupations.

Since tuition cost is higher in the high-skilled occupation, it follows that the high-skilled wage rate 
exceeds the low-skilled wage rate. This represents the return on the extra tuition costs in the high-
d 
e to 
skilled occupation. Forgone earning is not included as a cost of education, as individuals are assume
to earn all wage income in their second period of life. However, including first period wage incom
take account of forgone earnings would not change the functioning of this economy, as the non-
arbitrage condition for education imply that the extra wage income earned by a high-skilled equals the 
extra tuition costs. Hence, results are not likely to be affected by this simplification.

Due to the residence principle of taxation, the pre-tax return on domestic investments equals the 
foreign interest rate, and hence, is unaffected by taxation. Introduction of real capital into this model 
would not alter the first order conditions for labor due to this feature. Hence, real capital can be 
excluded from the production function without affecting any of the results obtained in this study.

3.4 THE FOREIGN BUDGET CONSTRAINT 
The second period production is given by the production function, (1). The Euler sentence and the first 
order conditions from the producer side, (7) and (8), imply that second period production equals the 
total factor income.  
                                                                               (9) 2211 nWnWY +=
This factor income is spent according to the budget constraints in the economy. Adding present value 
of consumption for all domestic individuals to the present value of government consumption, and 
applying their budget constraints and the equilibrium conditions in the economy, results in 
 [ ] YcrGnznzc =+++++ 222111 )1(   
Hence, the foreign budget is balanced when first period consumption plus tuition costs are financed by 
foreign loans that are repaid with interest in the second period. Allowing international trade in a 
capital good at the given interest rate is not sufficient to determine factor prices in this economy, as 
one traded good is insufficient to determine factor prices on two non-traded input factors. Hence, this 
trade does not exclude general equilibrium effects in the occupation specific wage rates in this 
economy.

One immediate implication is that there are no distributional effects from taxation in this economy. 
Any tax change that favors one occupation results in wage adjustments that neutralizes this favorable 
tax effect. However, these wage rate adjustments is generated by reallocation of individuals between 
occupations. The effect of each of the policy parameters is as follows: 
 
Tuition subsidies: 
Uniform tuition subsidies generate a first round benefit to individuals that choose the high-skilled 
occupation relative to individuals that choose the low-skilled occupation, because high-skilled pay 
more tuition costs. However, this benefit is neutralized as more individuals choose the high-skilled 
occupation. The high-skilled wage rate is reduced, while the low-skilled wage rate is increased. A 
more detailed discussion of this effect is found in Dur and Teulings (2004), and Heckman et al. 
(1998).  
 
Labor income taxation:  
Proportional taxation of labor income generates a first round loss to individuals in the high-skilled 
occupation relative to individuals in the low-skilled occupation because high-skilled earn more labor 
income. However, more individuals are allocated into the low-skilled occupation, and the occupation 
specific wage rates are adjusted to neutralize this loss.  
 
Capital income taxation: 
Capital income taxation generates a first round gain to individuals in the high-skilled occupation 
relative to individuals in the low-skilled occupation as high-skilled earn more second period income 
11 
which becomes more valuable because it allows them to save less financially. Hence, more individuals 
are allocated into the high-skilled occupation, and the wage rates are adjusted to neutralize this gain.    
 
4.2 PRODUCTION EFFICIENCY  
The production efficient allocation of individuals between occupations is obtained by maximizing 
present value of production net of tuition costs

5. OPTIMAL TAXATION  
5.1 THE FIRST-BEST  
The tax system is constrained to linear instruments, and does not include instruments that rely on 
variables that are individual-specific and/or non-observable to the government. First, pre-tax wage 
income differences only rely on choice of occupation in this study. However, such differences are 
unobservable to the government in real life due to individual-specific variables. To avoid tax rules that 
rely on such individual-specific and non-observable variables, progressive taxation of labor income is 
excluded from the study. Second, individuals are only categorized by choice of occupation in this 
study. Hence, occupation specific tuition subsidies are equivalent to individual-specific lumpsum 
subsidies in this framework. Such individual-specific instruments are excluded from the study by only 
including uniform tuition subsidies. Third, uniform lumpsum taxation is excluded due to its 
unfortunate distributional effects.  
 
Taxation creates two kinds of distortions in this economy. First, intertemporal consumption is 
distorted by capital income taxation as it reduces the return to financial saving. Second, the allocation 
of individuals between the two occupations is distorted when the tax parameters deviate from the 
combination that implies production efficiency, (13). A zero tax rate on capital income eliminates the 
distortion in intertemporal consumption. By implementing a zero tax rate on capital income into (13), 
it follows that a tuition subsidy rate equal to the labor income tax rate implies a production-efficient 
allocation of individuals. The labor income taxation leads to a larger tax payment from a high-skilled 
individual, as they earn more present value labor income. However, this extra tax burden is exactly 
offset by the extra tuition subsidies received due to a larger tuition cost. Hence, the government is able 
to implement the first-best allocation, and rise tax revenue at the same time.  
 
13 
5.2 TAXATION IN A SECOND-BEST SETTING  
The exclusion of factors liable to affect the design of the tax/ subsidy system leaves room for 
interesting extensions. First, non-verifiable learning is not included in this study. The presence of such 
learning is likely to limit the government's ability to neutralize tax distortions on choice of occupation 
by employing tuition subsidies. The limited ability to neutralize tax distortions by employing tuition 
subsidies can be represented by constraining the tuition subsidy rate to be lower than the labor income 
tax rate (see Jacobs and Bovenberg, 2004). Second, the labor/ leisure choice is not included in this 
study. The exclusion of this choice is likely to reduce the welfare cost of raising revenue. Hence, a 
reduction in the tuition subsidy rate, which reduces the need for tax revenue, is likely to generate a 
welfare gain that is not included in this study. However, constraining the tuition subsidy rate to be 
lower than the labor income tax rate is a second best approach for analyzing this effect. Such a 
constraint is included into this framework by setting the share of tuition costs paid by individuals, 
, proportionally to the share of wage income received by individuals, i.e. s?1 gs )1(1 ??=? , where 
.  1>g
 
The government chooses income tax rates to maximize the indirect utility function of a high-skilled 
individual, constrained by a public budget constraint and the specification of the economy. The non-
arbitrage condition for education, (10), is included as a constraint implying that all individuals receive 
the same utility. The indirect utility function is maximized with respect to  in addition to the tax 
rates due to this constraint.

The general equilibrium effects of the occupation-specific wage rates are incorporated into the 
government maximization problem by replacing the occupation-specific wage rates with their 
marginal products from the producer side of the economy, (7) and (8). These marginal products are 
determined by the allocation of individuals between the occupations. The non-arbitrage condition for 
education, which constitutes the first constraint of the maximization problem, determines the 
allocation of individuals between occupations for a given set of tax rates. The government budget 
constraint, which constitutes the second constraint of the maximization problem, states that the present 
value of tax revenue minus subsidies for tuition equals present value of government consumption (G). 
The first and second term are (present value) tax revenues from capital income taxation of individuals 
in occupation 1 and 2, respectively. First-period financial saving of individuals in occupation i, is 
multiplied by the number of individuals in occupation i, and by the interest rate, and the capital 
15 
income tax rate, and then discounted. The third and forth term are tax revenues from labor income 
minus subsidies for tuition from individuals in each of the occupations.  
 
The incentive to choose the high-skilled occupation is reduced, as the tuition subsidy rate is lowered 
relative to the labor income tax rate. The incentive is reduced because individuals pay a larger share of 
the tuition cost, and the tuition cost is higher in the high-skilled occupation. The subsequent 
reallocation of individuals from the high-skilled occupation, to the low-skilled occupation, restores the 
non-arbitrage condition for education by increasing the high-skilled wage rate, and lowering the low-
skilled wage rate. 
 
This preset distortion in choice of occupation forces the government to consider a tradeoff between the 
two sources of distortions in the economy. As the tuition subsidy rate is constrained relative to the 
labor income tax rate, the government is left with capital income taxation as a means to reduce the 
distortion in choice of occupation. The introduction of capital income taxation generates substitution 
away from financial saving, as the private returns to financial saving is reduced by a fraction equal to 
the tax rate. Since individuals in the low-skilled occupation borrow less financially, they harvest a 
smaller first round gain as a result of capital income taxation, compared to individuals in the high-
skilled occupation. To restore the non-arbitrage condition for education, more individuals choose the 
high-skilled occupation, and the wage rates are adjusted. However, as second-period consumption 
becomes more expensive relative to first-period consumption, individuals trade off second-period 
consumption for first-period consumption, hence, intertemporal consumption is distorted. 
 
The aim of this section is to find out whether capital income should be taxed, and whether production 
efficiency is desirable within this economy. The last question is equivalent to the question of whether 
general equilibrium effects of occupation-specific wage rates should be exploited to raise revenue. To 
answer these questions, a number of tradeoffs need to be considered. Capital income taxation 
generates a direct utility gain that is traded against the effect on the government budget, and the effects 
16 
of the general equilibrium responses. The direct effect on the government budget is negative, because 
individuals in both occupations borrow financially. The negative effect on the budget is magnified by 
a first-period consumption increase. The reallocation of individuals from the low-skilled to the high-
skilled occupation contributes to less capital income tax revenue as a high-skilled individual saves less 
financially, more labor income tax revenue as a high-skilled earns more labor income, and more 
tuition subsidy payments as a high-skilled receives more tuition subsidies. The subsequent wage 
decrease for high-skilled individuals generates a direct utility loss. However, less labor income tax 
revenue is generated, while the negative financial saving is reduced. The subsequent wage increase for 
low-skilled individuals generates more labor income tax revenue, and more negative financial saving. 
The labor income tax rate, and hence, the share of tuition costs paid by individuals, are adjusted to 
balance the government budget. This adjustment has a direct utility effect, however, the allocation of 
individuals between occupations is unaffected.  
  
The first question, whether capital should be taxed, is answered by employing the envelope theorem 
on the Lagrangian of the government maximization problem. The capital income tax rate is treated as 
an exogenous parameter in the maximization problem, and the welfare effect of introducing a marginal 
tax rate on capital income is given by the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the capital 
income tax rate when this tax rate is zero.

Since ?  is the Lagrangian parameter for the government budget constraint, and 
 is the marginal utility of present value income, it follows that the 
marginal cost of public funds equals unity when the capital income tax rate is zero.

This expression is positive when  because 1>g )1( g?  is the only negative factor in the numerator, 
while the denominator is positive. Hence, imposing a marginal capital income tax rate is welfare 
enhancing. The intuition is that the welfare cost of introducing a marginal distortion in intertemporal 
consumption must be smaller than the welfare gain of reducing the infra-marginal distortion in choice 
of occupation created by a tuition subsidy rate lower than the labor income tax rate.  
This result supports the conclusion in Jacobs and Bovenberg (2004) as it holds even in the presence of 
general equilibrium effects on occupation specific-wage rates.  
 
The second question, whether production efficiency is desirable, is analyzed by investigating whether 
the first order conditions of the government's maximization problem are violated when production 
efficiency is assumed. If these conditions are violated it follows that production efficiency is 
undesirable.

This expression is negative when  (which imply that 1>g 0>r? ), since )1( ??  is the only negative 
factor. Hence, it is not welfare enhancing to implement the production efficient allocation. This 
conclusion is opposite to that in Saez (2004). 
 
Note that gs )1(1 ??=?  implies that tax combinations generating production efficiency become a 
condition on the capital income tax rate: 
19

g

=?+ 1)1(1

Hence, production efficiency can be implemented by fixing the capital income tax rate. The envelope 
theorem implies that the welfare is reduced by a marginal increase in that capital income tax rate. The 
intuition for this result is that the welfare effect from the production side becomes marginal as the 
allocation of individuals is approaching the production efficient allocation. However, imposing a 
capital income tax required to obtain the production efficient allocation, generates a welfare cost due 
to distortion in intertemporal consumption that exceeds the marginal effect from the producer side.  
  
As it is optimal to reduce the allocation of high-skilled individuals relative to the production efficient 
solution, it follows that the wage difference between high and low-skilled should be increased 
compared to a production-efficient outcome. This conclusion is opposite to that in Naito (1999). The 
result is also related to Stiglitz (1982), and Allan (1982), who find that production efficiency may no 
longer be desirable when labor supply is elastic. The elastic labor supply assumption is used to justify 
the constraint on the tuition subsidy rate in this study.    
 
 
6. CONCLUSION AND POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS  
This study introduces occupational choices based on lifetime income in a framework where labor skill 
types are imperfect substitutes in production. Optimal taxation in the case where the tuition subsidy 
rate is constrained to be lower than the labor income tax rate, induces the government to trade 
efficiency in production against distortions in intertemporal consumption, as the capital income tax 
rate is used as a second-best instrument to reduce the distortion in choice of occupation. Hence, the 
result in Jacobs and Bovenberg (2004) holds in a framework where general equilibrium effects on 
occupation-specific wage rates are incorporated. The solution implies increased wage differences 
20 
between high and low-skilled occupations compared to a production-efficient outcome. This 
conclusion is opposite to that in Saez (2004) and Naito (1999).  
 
The analysis does not cover all aspects of optimal income taxation and subsidies for tuition. The 
transition period, i.e. the period it takes to adjust the relative supply of high and low-skilled labor, is 
not considered in this study. However, the optimal solution implies a relative increase in the stock of 
low-skilled workers compared to the production efficient solution. An increase in the supply of low-
skilled labor is likely to occur within a relatively short period of time, as more young unskilled 
individuals can enter directly into the labor force. Adjustments in the supply of high-skilled labor is 
likely to occur more gradually, as individuals need to spend time in school to become high-skilled 
workers. Introducing liquidity constraints is an interesting extension. Another interesting aspect is how 
the allocation of high and low-skilled labor affects the growth rate. Romer (1990) argues that wage 
rates for high-skilled labor are lower than their productivity because of positive external effects from 
employing them in the research sector. Hence, in a second-best solution, where the government has no 
direct instrument to affect the allocation of high-skilled in the research sector, the education of high-
skilled individuals should be subsidized. Further, including ability differences and distributional 
considerations could reveal interesting tradeoffs between efficiency and equity.
