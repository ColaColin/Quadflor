This paper examines the impact of the recent global crisis on emerging market economies 
(EMs). Our cross-country analysis shows that the impact of the crisis was more pronounced in 
those EMs that had initial weaker fundamentals and greater financial and trade linkages. This 
effect is observed along a number of dimensions, such as growth, stock market performance, 
sovereign spreads, and credit growth. This paper also shows that during this crisis, pre-crisis 
reserve holdings helped to mitigate the initial growth collapse. This finding contrasts with other 
studies that fail to find a significant relationship between reserves and the growth decline. This 
paper argues that our preferred measure of impact is a more accurate reflection of the true 
impact of the crisis on EMs.

I.   INTRODUCTION1 
The global economy is by now emerging from the largest shock in the post-war era. 
Following years characterized by strong global growth and increasing trade and financial 
linkages, the implosion in advanced economy financial centers, especially after the collapse 
of Lehman in September 2008, quickly spilled over to emerging market economies (EMs). 
As a result, growth of the global economy fell by 6 percentage points from its pre-crisis peak 
to its trough in 2009, the largest straight fall in global growth in the post-war era. Similarly, 
real output in EMs fell about 4 percent between 2008Q3 and 2009Q1, the most intense period 
of the crisis. However, this average performance masked considerable variation across EMs. 
Ranking EMs by output impact, those in the worst affected quartile—mostly in emerging 
Europe—experienced a 11 percent real output contraction during the period while those EMs 
in the least affected quartile saw their output grow by 1 percent.  
Against this backdrop, this paper explores the channels and factors that shaped the initial 
impact of the crisis on emerging market economies with a view to explaining the observed 
heterogeneous experience across EMs. Using a sample of around 50 emerging market 
economies, the impact of the crisis is measured along several dimensions, including the 
actual decline in quarterly growth, the decline in stock markets, the rise in sovereign spreads, 
and the decline in credit growth. To account for initial conditions and pre-crisis 
fundamentals, this paper uses a unique measure of vulnerabilities developed by IMF staff 
that, by virtue of its construction, allows for a consistent comparison of vulnerabilities across 
EMs. Given that for most EMs this was an externally driven crisis, this paper focuses on 
external sector vulnerabilities prior to the crisis, including current account deficits, reserve 
holdings, and external debt levels among others. 
The paper’s primary findings are twofold: (i) as expected, countries that were more open to 
trade and financial linkages were more affected by the crisis and (ii) countries that had 
improved policy fundamentals and reduced vulnerabilities in the pre-crisis period reaped the 
benefits of these reforms during the crisis. In other words, controlling for other determinants 
of impact such as trade and financial openness, countries that had better pre-crisis 
fundamentals and vulnerability indicators experienced less severe output contractions and 
widening of sovereign spreads. Furthermore, higher international reserves holdings, by 
reducing external vulnerability, helped buffer the impact of the crisis. But reserves had 
diminishing returns: at very high levels of reserves there is little discernable evidence of their 
moderating impact on output collapse.

To our knowledge, this is the first paper that finds a significant and robust relationship, a 
non-linear one, between EMs’ reserve holdings and the actual decline in growth experienced 
during the crisis. This could owe to the fact that our preferred measure of impact, estimated 
as the country-specific peak-to-trough decline in quarterly real GDP, is a more accurate 
measure of impact that those used in related papers (Berkmen and others (2009), Lane and 
Milesi-Ferretti (2010), and Blanchard and others. (2010)). These studies either use annual 
data, which do not give any indication of important intra-annual variations in growth, or 
assume that growth peaks and troughs across EMs took place in the same quarter. As it will 
be shown, countries entered and exited the crisis at very different points in time. Another 
contribution of this paper to the literature is the systematic analysis of the impact of the crisis 
on financial variables such as sovereign spreads and credit growth. 
The role played by pre-crisis vulnerabilities has important implications for policy makers. 
During the thick of the crisis around the time of Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, EM asset 
prices fell across the board. At the time it was not clear whether EMs that had invested in 
improving fundamentals in the preceding years would fare any better than others. The main 
message from this paper is that markets do discriminate across EMs and prior progress was 
rewarded. Countries that entered the crisis with lower vulnerabilities had worked to reduce 
them in the preceding period Figure 1. This message also highlights the need for EMs 
emerging from the crisis with high vulnerabilities to protect themselves against future 
shocks. 
 
This paper contributes to and enhances the body of literature assessing the impact of the 
crisis on EMs. In a comparable analysis, Berkmen and others (2009) use a similar sample of 
EMs but their measure of impact looks at “revisions of projections for GDP growth in 2009, 
comparing forecasts prior to and after the intensification of the crisis in September 2008.” 
This is not an optimal measure of impact as growth forecasts could be subject to the

forecaster’s bias and, moreover, forecasters may change across vintages. Exploring the 
impact of the crisis on growth, consumption, and domestic demand, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti 
(2010) find no evidence that greater financial integration amplified the impact of the crisis 
while Berglöf and others (2009) only find mixed evidence. Results in these two studies may 
be affected by the choice of countries in their sample, as the former combines advanced 
economies with emerging markets and low income countries while the latter focuses on 
Emerging Europe. On the other hand, analysis by the BIS (2009a, 2009b) suggests that 
financial connectedness did indeed matter. Rose and Spiegel (2009a, 2009b) fail to find any 
link between the behavior of the most widely-used determinants of crises and the incidence 
of the crisis across countries. However, the sample used is restricted to declines in growth 
through 2008, a sample cut too short to capture the full impact of the crisis. 
II.   A BROAD VIEW OF THE IMPACT OF THE CRISIS 
While the global crisis started in financial centers in the advanced economies (AEs), it took a 
heavy toll on EMs: the median EM suffered a somewhat larger decline in output than the 
median AE, 4.9 percent for the former against 4.5 percent for the latter, measured from the 
pre-crisis peak to the trough during the crisis (see Table 1a). Moreover, the impact was more 
varied in EMs, with several EMs affected more than the worst-hit AEs while some other EMs 
continued to grow through the crisis period. High frequency financial variables exhibit 
similar behavior. While on average EMs experienced as large a decline in stock markets and 
a widening of sovereign spreads as AEs, there was considerably greater cross-country 
variability in EMs. The next sections in this paper will use regression analysis to shed some 
light on the factors and country characteristics determining these differing outcomes.

A convenient way to approach the analysis of the impact of the crisis is to classify EMs on 
the basis of their pre-crisis vulnerabilities. Pre-crisis vulnerabilities can be measured in 
different ways.2 However, measuring vulnerabilities consistently across countries and over 
time can be a challenging task. IMF staff has developed a methodology for this purpose as 
part of the internal semi-annual vulnerability exercise for emerging market economies (VEE; 
see Box 1).3 Given that for most EMs this was an externally driven crisis, this paper primarily 
uses the indicator-based external vulnerability index from the spring 2007 round of the VEE, 
the last exercise before the onset of market volatility in late 2007. The terms “low,” 
“medium,” and “high” vulnerability as used in the rest of the paper pertain to the ratings on 
this vulnerability index in the spring 2007 round of the VEE. It is worth noting that of the 
“high” vulnerability group, about half the countries was located in Emerging Europe. The 
country sample used in the paper is provided in Appendix 1. 
The impact of the crisis can be measured along several dimensions: 
 Impact on the real economy. As will be further elaborated in the next section, the 
preferred measure of real impact in this paper is the percent change in seasonally 
adjusted quarterly GDP from each country’s peak to its respective trough during the 
crisis. 4  
 Impact on financial markets and the banking sector. This is measured, for each 
country, by the (a) change in the average monthly stock market index during the 
crisis; (b) collapse in real private sector credit growth from its peak to trough and the 
difference between pre- and post-crisis average monthly credit flows in percent of 
GDP; and (c) rise in the average monthly EMBI sovereign spread from its trough to 
peak (in basis points). Similar to the output loss analysis, country variation in peaks 
and troughs is taken into account. 
These measures of impact tend to provide a consistent story. Table 1b shows simple 
correlation coefficient between the peak to trough percentage change in real GDP, credit 
growth, spreads and stock markets. The result suggest that those EMs that fell more in 
financial terms also fell more in real terms, which was also accompanied by a credit collapse. 
                                                 
2 The terms “vulnerabilities” and “fundamentals” are used interchangeably in this paper.  Box 1 describes the 
specific metrics used to measure vulnerabilities. 
3 The VEE was established in 2001 to inform staff’s surveillance of emerging market countries. It examines 
several indicators against thresholds in the public, external, financial, and corporate sectors, to classify a 
country as having a “low,” “medium,” or “high” underlying vulnerability in each sector and overall. For 
confidentiality reasons it is not published. Box 1 provides more details. 
4 An alternative measure of impact could be the change in output between 2008Q3 and 2009Q1, the peak and 
trough, respectively, for the typical EM. However, there is considerable country level variation in peaks and 
troughs and using this approach would have been accurate for only around one half of the EMs in the sample. 
7 
 
 
Notably, both credit and growth are correlated with spreads and stocks (with expected signs). 
A somewhat surprising result is that changes in stock markets do not appear to be correlated 
with changes in spreads. This could owe to the fact that markets differentiated between 
stresses in the sovereign and stresses in the corporate sector. For example, an EM that has a 
strong fiscal position may not experience a rise in spreads although the stock market could 
take a hit as exporting companies’ earnings prospect falls. China, for example, only saw a 84 
bps rise in spreads (in the best performing quartile) but its stock market fell by 67 percent 
(median fall is 57 percent).    
 
Turning now to developments in financial markets, a pattern of re-coupling leading to re-
decoupling emerges in the financial transmission of the crisis. This finding lends some 
support to arguments made in the years prior to the crisis over the possibility that some EMs 
had “decoupled” from AEs. That is, EMs were no longer dependent on AEs demand to 
sustain robust rates of growth. To further assess financial developments across EMs in 
relation to AEs and how investors differentiated between countries, Figure 2 traces daily 
stock market indices across AEs and EMs by their level of vulnerability in spring 2007. 
Similar to several other studies, the start of the crisis is taken to be August 9, 2007 when 
three funds that had invested in subprime mortgages were suspended from trading and the 
Fed, ECB, and BoJ undertook coordinated liquidity injection. 5 Three phases of transmission 
emerge:  
 Decoupling. First, some EMs seemed to decouple from AEs between the start of the 
crisis and collapse of Lehman. Until a few weeks before Lehman’s bankruptcy 
announcement, stock markets in low and medium pre-crisis vulnerability EMs were 
15 percent below their levels of August 2007, while those in AEs and high 
vulnerability EMs had already fallen around 30 percent.

 Re-coupling. This differentiation across emerging markets came to an end in the 
second phase as Lehman’s collapse triggered panic in the global economic landscape 
and all EMs fell almost uniformly.  
 Re-decoupling. With the return of stability in the third phase of transmission, EMs re-
decoupled and a striking gap opened between high vulnerability countries and others. 
Overall, since August 2007, while stock markets in low and medium vulnerability 
countries have broadly recovered to pre-crisis levels, those in countries with high 
vulnerabilities on the eve of the crisis remain depressed. This pattern of market 
discrimination has continued during the recent sovereign crisis in Europe’s periphery: 
during the April-May period of highest turbulence, stock markets declined by around 
7 percent in the low and medium vulnerability economies, by around 13 percent in 
the high vulnerability ones, and by around 17 percent in AEs. 
 
The pattern in the fall in the stock market indices is also reflected in the capital flows data. 
Figure 3 shows that gross portfolio flows fell in the last quarter of 2008 for all EMs and in 
spite of their vulnerability ratings. However, starting from the first quarter of 2009, EMs with 
low and medium vulnerabilities already started to see positive portfolio flows while those 
with high vulnerabilities still experienced gross outflows. Experience across regions is also 
striking. Emerging Europe, home to many EMs with high vulnerabilities, did not see 
portfolio flows coming back until 2009Q2, while in other regions such as Asia, portfolio 
flows never did experience much of a decline.

As regards the macroeconomic impact, countries that experienced a decline in vulnerabilities 
before the crisis came out well ahead of others and experienced shallower downturns. This is 
illustrated in both the timing of experiencing a fall in output and the magnitude of the 
decline: 
 Timing of collapse in real activity. By the third quarter of 2008, the majority of 
countries that had high or medium pre-crisis vulnerabilities were contracting (Figure 
4; left panel). In contrast, low pre-crisis vulnerability EMs held out longer before 
succumbing to global headwinds. Even through the worst of the crisis in 2009Q1, 
many low vulnerability countries did not experience a fall in output. Similarly, in the 
recovery phase, economies with low and medium pre-crisis vulnerabilities have 
tended to return to positive quarterly growth much sooner than those with high 
vulnerabilities.    
 Magnitude of collapse in real activity. A similar message emerges from a 
comparison of the magnitude of the fall in real GDP (Figure 4; right panel). Countries 
with low and medium vulnerabilities suffered much smaller real output collapses and 
are experiencing much steeper recoveries than other EMs. These countries also 
contracted much less than AEs.

An interesting and perhaps surprising result emerging from the analysis above is that highly 
vulnerable EMs experienced a smaller initial fall in output during this crisis than EMs in past 
crises.6 The global coordinated response to this crisis and the provision of quick and large 
amounts of financing from international institutions, including the IMF, allowed countries to 
smooth adjustment. In addition, past EM crises often involved banking crises, which was not 
the case this time round. This was partly due to the crisis having emerged in AE financial 
centers, but also probably owed to the general absence of currency crises that could have 
severely impaired banks and corporate balance sheets. Moreover, many EMs entered this 
crisis on the back of improvements in financial and corporate sectors vulnerability indicators 
(Figure 5). An exception is the average trend for European EMs, where financial sector 
vulnerabilities did not improve during 2000−07, unlike in other regions where there was a 
substantial improvement. 
On the other hand, for countries with weak fundamentals, this crisis may turn out to be more 
protracted than past crisis, which tended to exhibit more of a U-shaped recovery. This result 
is line with the IMF (2009a and 2009b) finding that recessions after financial crisis are 
unusually long, particularly in the context of a global downturn. 
                                                 
6 Past capital account crisis cases—for comparison purposes—are Mexico (1994), Indonesia (1997), Korea 
(1997), Malaysia (1997), Philippines (1997), Thailand (1997), Brazil (1998), Colombia (1998), Ecuador (1998), 
Russia (1998), Turkey (2000), Argentina (2001), and Uruguay (2001). Dates in parentheses are those of crisis 
inception. Comparisons with past crises should be interpreted with caution, owing to differing external 
circumstances prevailing during different episodes. Ramakrishnan and Zalduendo (2006) and Reinhart and 
Rogoff (2008) use similar country samples of past crises.

III.   ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS 
A. Measuring impact: Alternative metrics 
The analysis in this paper was undertaken using four alternative measures of output loss to 
better assess the robustness of the findings to the choice of impact measure: 
 A simple gauge is how far output fell in the two quarters after the collapse of Lehman 
Brothers, measured by the percentage change in seasonally adjusted real GDP 
between 2008Q3 and 2009Q1. In this paper, we refer to this measure as “Growth 1,” 
similar to that used by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2010) in that it applies equal timing 
to all countries in the sample. 
 A drawback of Growth 1 is that it does not take into account growth dynamics prior 
to the crisis and where output might have been in the absence of a crisis. To gauge 
output loss in that (counterfactual) sense, a second growth measure (“Growth 2”) is 
calculated as the log difference between actual seasonally adjusted real GDP in 
2009Q1 and a counterfactual projection for real GDP in 2009Q1 based on a linear 
trend estimated over 2003-2007. This approach is similar in spirit to that used by 
Abiad and others (2010) to evaluate medium-term output dynamics following 
banking crises. 
 The above two measures implicitly assume each EM’s output peaked in 2008Q3 and 
troughed in 2009Q1. However, as already shown, there is considerable heterogeneity 
in the timing of the crisis across countries. Indeed, this timing would only be accurate 
for about half the sample. Therefore, a third measure was devised (“Growth 3”),

which is the country-specific peak to trough percent change in quarterly seasonally 
adjusted real GDP. This measure of impact is unique to our study. 
 Finally, a fourth measure (“Growth 4”) was calculated that takes into account cross-
country heterogeneity in both the counterfactual growth path and the timing of 
recovery. It was defined as the log difference between actual seasonally adjusted real 
GDP at the country’s trough, and projected real GDP based on a linear trend 
estimated over 2003−07.  
The preferred measure in this paper is “growth 3,” based on the actual change in output and 
each country’s peak and trough. This is a more accurate and an easier to interpret measure of 
impact. Moreover, one shortcoming of using “growth 4” is that it may overestimate the 
impact of the crisis. In some countries growth in 2003-07 was unsustainably high and would 
have slowed down even without the crisis. As depicted in Figure 6, “growth 3” is highly 
correlated with “growth 1” and “growth 4,” though the correlation is stronger with “growth 
4” (right panel) as can be seen from the tighter alignment of the scatter plot along the 45 
degree line. While the results are robust to using either of these measures the analysis below 
will focus on the last two. Analogous to “growth 3,” country-specific peak to trough changes 
were also estimated for EMBI spreads and for credit growth.

B. Impact on growth 
This section assesses the impact of pre-crisis external vulnerabilities on output collapse, 
controlling for global linkages. The primary regression specification used in this paper 
explains the fall in real output as a function of (a) pre-crisis vulnerabilities; (b) trade 
connectedness with the rest of the world; and (c) international financial integration. After 
trying several alternative measures for each of these three categories, the following three 
measures best explained the cross-country variation of impact: (a) the external vulnerability 
index in the Spring 2007 round of the VEE; (b) the percent change in domestic demand of 
AE trading partners weighted by trade shares and computed over a similar period to the peak-
to-trough change in each EM’s output; and (c) the consolidated stock of claims of BIS 
reporting banks (immediate borrower basis) on EMs in percent of the EM’s GDP in 
December 2007. A number of other indicators, including regional dummies and type of 
exchange rate regime, were tried as part of the empirical analysis, either as alternatives for 
the above three or as additional controls, but they did not affect the central findings (Table in 
Appendix 2). 
The least vulnerable EMs, on average, contracted 6½ percentage points less than the most 
vulnerable EMs (Table 2a). All four factors that influence the external vulnerability index 
were also individually significant, with the exception of external debt in percent of exports 
(Table 2a, columns 2–5).7 More externally vulnerable EMs, in particular those with high 
current account deficits, may have experienced sharper declines in domestic demand, 
contributing to the decline in output. In many instances, countries with high external 
vulnerabilities were the countries with pre-crisis domestic demand booms fueled by capital-
inflows, which ended when the capital inflows suddenly stopped.8 Other standard sectoral 
vulnerability indicators—fiscal, financial, corporate—do not stand out as significant factors 
in explaining the output decline. 
Trade linkages were another important determinant of output collapse. Coefficients from the 
first regression in Table 2a indicate that EMs experienced an additional 1½ percentage point 
reduction in real output during the crisis for every percentage point fall in domestic demand 
in their advanced economy trading partners. Large EMs, for who exports formed a smaller 
component of their aggregate demand (such as Indonesia and India), consequently 
experienced smaller real shocks. As has been documented elsewhere, trade fell more in this 
crisis than in past global recessions, in part a reflection of increasing interconnectedness and 
the responsiveness of global supply chains (Freund, 2009). Nevertheless, contrary to early 
concerns, problems with trade finance were not a principal cause of the sharp collapse in 
                                                 
7 As noted in Box 1, these four factors cannot be added simultaneously to the regression due to collinearity.  
8 Bakker and Gulde (2010) for example shows that the decline in domestic demand was most pronounced in the 
countries that had built up the largest imbalances during the boom years for emerging European countries.

trade. Also, even though trade dispute filings intensified during the crisis, a wholesale rise in 
protectionism did not materialize. 
 
To check the robustness of the results to the choice of impact measure, Table 2b replicates 
the regression specifications in Table 2a but replacing “growth 3” with “growth 4” as 
dependent variable. The results are consistent with those previously obtained for all 
specifications. Indeed, the results appear to be stronger, with somewhat higher R-squared 
values. The least vulnerable EMs, on average, now contracts 7½ percentage points less than 
the most vulnerable EMs.

C. The role of reserves 
A key finding in this paper is that pre-crisis reserve holdings were associated with positive 
but diminishing returns with respect to output collapse. As one of the components of the 
vulnerability index, a higher ratio of reserves to external financing requirements—defined as 
the sum of short-term debt (at residual maturity) and the current account deficit—helped to 
reduce external vulnerabilities (Table 2a, column 2). As Figure 7 confirms, higher reserves 
had a significant payoff in terms of output loss at low levels of reserve coverage but much 
less so at high levels of coverage, especially if the costs of holding reserves are taken into 
account (Rodrik, 2006).9 Indeed, at very high levels of reserves the marginal gain from 
holding additional reserves is largely negligible. This non-linear relationship between output 
collapse and reserve holding observed during this crisis also holds when very large values of 
reserve holdings are removed.  
 
                                                 
9 Blanchard and others (2010) do not find a significant role for international reserves in explaining output 
collapse once they control for short-term debt. However, they do not explore potential non-linear relationships 
between reserves and output collapse. Also, this paper uses data on more emerging markets and has a different 
measure of output collapse that uses country-specific variation in timing of peaks and troughs of output during 
the crisis.

Reserve coverage robustness regressions 
Recent literature (Blanchard and others, 2010) suggests that it is the denominator – short-
term debt – rather than the numerator – reserves – that is important in explaining the output 
collapse during the crisis. However, our results suggest otherwise. While for low reserve 
coverage reserves alone are able explain the fall in output, this relationship does not hold in 
the case of high reserve countries, confirming the non-linearity of the relationship. On the 
other hand, for countries with high reserves levels, output losses are magnified as the ratio of 
short-term debt to GDP increases. As discussed below, these results are robust to alternative 
specifications.10 
In order to test the significance of reserves in explaining the observed output collapse and the 
non-linearities in the relationship, we proceed as follows: (i) the reserve coverage variable is 
replaced by its individual components, that is reserves, short-term debt, and current account 
balance, each expressed in percent of GDP, (ii) the sample is split by the ratio of reserve to 
short term debt (at 100 or 150 percent11) or at the median level of reserves-to-GDP ratio (17.2 
percent), and (iii) we run similar regressions as 2a and 2b using the variables in (i) and the 
splits in (ii) plus additional control variables. 
Column 1 of Table 3 presents regression results for the full sample of EMs. In line with the 
findings by Blanchard and others (2010), the reserves variable has no statistically significant 
effect, while short-term debt seems to explain output collapse. However, the results in 
columns 2 to 7 show that the reserves become significant only at low reserve levels. As we 
move to higher levels of reserves, the impact of short-term debt becomes significant and the 
magnitude of its impact increases (as implied by a greater coefficient). The results are robust 
to controlling for the size of the economy using variables such as pre-crisis (2007) per capita 
GDP, GDP adjusted for purchasing power parity, pre-crisis credit growth (for the period 
2003-2007), 12 size of credit to GDP ratio and size of domestic demand relative to GDP 
(Appendix 1, Tables A1-A3).  
Using alternative definitions of growth such as “growth1” (similar in spirit to Lane and 
Milesi-Ferretti, 2010)) and “growth 4” as a dependent variable does not change the results. 
Indeed, using “growth 4” intensifies the significance of the positive linear relationship 
(between growth and reserves) for EMs with low reserve coverage and increases the 
significance of the results (Tables A4-A5).  
 
                                                 
10 Results were examined to ensure they were not being driven by outliers. 
 
11 Increasing the threshold beyond 150 percent would significantly reduce the number of observations for this 
regression. 
12 Pre-crisis trend growth is the average growth rate in the 5 years preceding the crisis (2003-2007).

Reserve usage 
An important empirical evidence of this crisis is that countries that had more reserves going 
into the crisis made greater use of them during the crisis period in order to avoid sharp 
depreciations that could have had pronounced implications on corporate, household, and 
bank balance sheets, potentially creating a systemic event.  
 
Having reserves helped Russia, for example, to avoid a systemic financial crisis by allowing 
some space for corporates and banks to adjust to a revised global outlook with lower oil

prices.13 Nevertheless, this strategy also had costs. Some market participants were able to 
benefit from speculating on the eventual devaluation and bank balance sheets would need to 
adjust to be able to resume intermediation and support the recovery. Figure 9 plots the peak 
to trough sale of reserves in percent of 2008 GDP. On average countries lost around 7 
percent of their GDP equivalent of international reserves either to protect the currency or the 
balance sheets.  
 
 
D. Impact on sovereign spreads 
Pre-crisis external vulnerabilities also help to explain the rise in sovereign spreads during the 
crisis (Table 4). Controlling for other factors, the country considered most externally 
vulnerable in Spring 2007 experienced a greater widening in spreads than the country 
considered least vulnerable (by around 220 basis points) (Table 4, column 1). In addition, as 
in the regressions explaining the extent of output collapse, the ratio of reserves to short-term 
external financing needs influenced market perceptions of a country’s sovereign risk during 
the crisis (Table 4, column 2), and countries with greater reserves coverage experienced a 
smaller increase in spreads. Two other factors also affected sovereign spreads: cumulative 
inflation in the years preceding the crisis and having an inflation-targeting regime. Both 
likely affected market perceptions of policy credibility and whether macroeconomic stability 
                                                 
13 As the crisis unfolded, Russia spent more than $200 billion of its reserves (representing 13 percent of 2008 
GDP, one of the largest declines amongst EMs) in tempering the pressure on the ruble, but eventually allowed 
for a significant fall in the exchange rate.

would be maintained. Surprisingly pre-crisis fiscal vulnerabilities do not have significant 
impact on the change in spreads. This may reflect the forward looking nature of such market 
indicator that takes into account the crisis cost on the public sector and the structural fiscal 
change in the post-crisis period. For example, Latvia’s pre-crisis public debt to GDP ratio 
was less than 20 percent, but its change in spread was more than 700 bps, much higher than 
EM median. On the other hand, Brazil’s level of public debt was almost 60 percent but its 
spreads only rose by less than 300 bps. 
Market nervousness was exacerbated early in the crisis period across emerging markets due 
to concerns about the size of external debt (and uncertainties around external financing) and 
banks’ exposure to weaker banks and instruments in advanced economies i.e. exposure to 
subprime mortgages and financial derivatives. For example, in Indonesia, unclear external 
liabilities data led market participants—who still had memories of the Asian crisis where 
external liabilities turned out to be larger than anticipated—to panic, which led to sharp 
increase in volatility in financial markets and spreads. On the other hand, in Philippines, 
continuous information dissemination among market participants helped to contain volatility 
in financial markets.14  
 
                                                 
14 The creation of a communication strategy between the National Bank of Philippines and the commercial 
banks (Sunshine Group) improved transparency within the sector and among market participants that helped 
mitigate the rise in spreads.

E. Impact on Credit 
Pre-crisis credit booms—in many cases funded from abroad—generally ended in credit and 
output busts. Cross border claims of BIS reporting banks on EMs on the eve of the crisis 
ranged from close to zero to around 37 percent of GDP across countries in the sample. Such 
lending was typically associated with credit booms and subsequent credit busts, especially 
for countries with fixed exchange rates (Table 5 and Figure 10). A country that had double 
the average level of claims of about 7 percent of GDP experienced an additional 
1¼ percentage points in output reduction (Table 2a). Credit busts were also associated with 
sharp increases in money market rates which are a symptom of a credit crunch.15 The impact 
of global deleveraging on credit growth in EMs was particularly pronounced in Emerging 
Europe where cross-border lending had been growing sharply before the crisis. When global 
wholesale funding markets dried up and international banks were forced to stop asset growth 
as part of global deleveraging, domestic credit growth fell from pre-crisis highs to close to 
zero. This is consistent with the finding (e.g., Kamil and Rai, 2010) that EMs whose banking 
systems were primarily funded by domestic deposits were better able to sustain credit growth 
and support activity through the crisis.16 
 
                                                 
15 See also Aisen and Franken (2010) who find that larger pre-crisis credit booms and the increase in money 
market rates during the crisis were important determinants of post-crisis credit slowdown.

Notwithstanding global deleveraging, credit busts in EMs have been less damaging than 
during past crises (Figure 11, left panel). The change in the growth rate of private credit was 
more pronounced for countries with high pre-crisis vulnerabilities.17 Nevertheless, through 
2009Q4 these countries had not experienced sharply negative credit growth as in past crises. 
This was despite the fact that pre-crisis credit booms had been more pronounced this time 
round than in past crises. The seemingly benign outcome may reflect the lack of currency and 
banking crises and the support provided by the international community, although it is 
possible that some EMs have yet to reach their credit growth trough. 18 In fact, this is also 
reflected in bank lending behavior in this crisis. Figure 11 shows that the exposure of BIS 
banks in emerging Europe remains flat, a stark difference from the steep fall during the past 
crises. 
 
                                                 
17 Using firm level data in 24 EMs, Tong and Wei (2009) find that pre-crisis exposure to non-FDI capital flows 
worsened the credit crunch, while exposure to FDI flows was associated with less constraints on credit. 
18 One helpful initiative in this crisis, as compared to past crises, was the European Bank Coordination Initiative 
under which private banks affirmed their commitments to maintain overall exposure to the countries covered by 
the initiative.

Countries with greater initial fiscal vulnerabilities and where interbank liquidity dried up 
experienced higher banking sector risks during the crisis (Figure 12). There are relatively few 
objective measures of banking sector risks that are available as a time series for a cross-
section of countries. One of these, Moody’s measure of expected default frequency (EDF), is 
used to measure the increase in banks’ default probability from the pre-crisis trough to its 
peak during the crisis.19 Countries that entered the crisis with higher fiscal vulnerabilities, as 
measured by the public sector vulnerability index, experienced a higher rise in this measure 
of default probability, likely reflecting market concerns that such countries may not have the 
means to easily address possible bank solvency problems. Also, as expected, higher default 
probabilities were associated with tighter inter-bank liquidity conditions, as measured by 
money market rates, reflecting in part risks in the banking system, including counterparty 
risk. 
 
F. Further issues 
While the empirical framework of this paper explains well the experience of EMs on 
average, there is important country specific variability in outcomes (Figure 13). The analysis 
presented in the preceding sections explains about half of the observed cross-country 
variation, depending on the particular specification. Nevertheless, with only about 50 EMs in 
the main sample, it is statistically difficult to have too many explanatory factors. Thus 
important differences may arise between outcomes that could be explained by the empirical 
models and actual country experiences. 
                                                 
19 EDF is the calculated probability that a firm may default within the one-year (ahead) period. Data are 
available from Moody’s KMV where EDF is calculated based on each firm’s market value of assets, its 
volatility, and its current capital structure. EDFs for banking groups are available for 21 emerging markets. 
Peak-to-trough EDF is computed based on the monthly (end of month) median EDF for each EM banking group 
during January 2007–January 2010.

In many EMs, fiscal consolidation and financial sector reforms in the years preceding the 
crisis contributed to a marked improvement of market perception of their resilience to the 
crisis. Improved fiscal position and lower financial sector risks helped to create room for 
reserve accumulation, lowering external vulnerabilities and consequently mitigating output 
losses. For example, based on the empirical estimation in Table 2, output would have fallen 
by 4 percent had the Philippines entered the crisis with its external vulnerabilities as in 2005, 
instead of the actual fall from peak to trough of 2¼ percent.20  
Commodity price developments were also an important factor in explaining the collapse in 
some of the emerging market economies. For example, when oil prices collapsed in the midst 
of the global recession, market participants in Russia revised their outlook for the economy 
and the ruble. Domestic demand plunged due to the immediate terms of trade shock but also 
in anticipation of a bleaker outlook. At the same time, capital outflows, banks’ increased risk 
aversion, and an associated credit crunch exacerbated the collapse. Output fell sharply by 
about 11 percentage points of GDP from peak to trough, one of the largest output collapses in 
EMs despite lower external vulnerabilities and foreign bank claims (in percent of GDP) 
                                                 
20 Remittances, lack of prior overheating and strengthened financial sector also helped the Philippines weather 
the crisis. At around 11 percent of GDP in 2009, remittances are an important component of the overall external 
position and a key driver of domestic demand. Moreover, the Philippines did not experience the kind of 
overheating some other EMs experienced in the run up to the crisis.

going into the crisis, two of the factors that were important in explaining the experience on 
average across EMs.  
Those economies with stronger domestic demand, such as Indonesia, continued to grow 
during the crisis. Domestic demand constituted the bulk of output in Indonesia (around 90 
percent of real GDP in 2007). Thus, even though Indonesia’s advanced economy trading 
partners experienced a sharper decline in domestic demand of 3¼ percent compared to that 
for the average EM of around 2¾ percent, the impact on Indonesia’ economy was much 
lower. Many other EMs that also either grew through the crisis or experienced a small 
adverse impact had large domestic markets (China, Egypt, India).21 
 
IV.   CONCLUSIONS 
EMs’ heterogeneous experience during the crisis underscores the importance of economic 
fundamentals and global linkages. Controlling for factors beyond their control, EMs with 
smaller initial vulnerabilities went into recession later and exited earlier, and suffered 
considerably smaller declines in output during the first stage of the crisis. EMs with stronger 
external linkages—higher dependence on demand from AEs or larger exposure to foreign 
bank claims—experienced sharper falls in output during the crisis. The analysis also 
indicates that countries that experienced pre-crisis credit booms experienced sharper output 
falls during the crisis, although to a lesser extent than during previous crisis episodes. Such 
credit booms were typically foreign-financed and more pronounced for countries with fixed 
exchange rate regimes.  
Reserves, up to a limit, helped dampen the impact of the crisis on EMs. Higher levels of pre-
crisis reserve cover were associated with less deterioration in both sovereign spreads and 
output during the crisis. However, this effect was subject to diminishing returns: EMs 
enjoyed little additional benefit for having reserves in excess of the sum of short-term debt 
and the current account deficit.  
Future work could be pursued to better understand the determinants of the fall in the stock 
market prices which is not covered in this paper. The role of the capital flows and its impact 
on growth during the crisis also deserves further research.  
  
                                                 
21 When a formal measure of the size of the economy, or openness, is included in the regressions, it does not 
perform well. In part this could reflect that the contribution made by external demand to domestic value added 
cannot be captured well by such simple measures.

Box 1. Assessments of Underlying Vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Countries 
 
Underpinning the analysis in this paper are staff assessments of pre-crisis vulnerabilities. These 
measures were developed—for emerging market countries with access to international capital 
markets—in the aftermath of the capital account crises of the late 1990s to inform surveillance and 
staff assessments of crisis probabilities. Since the establishment of the exercise in 2001, the 
methodology has been updated. These assessments, conducted semi-annually, comprise cross-country 
analysis of vulnerability indicators along with country-specific judgments. 
The assessment proceeds in several steps. First, data on vulnerabilities—flow and stock measures 
derived from previous IMF studies as well as academic literature on empirical early warning system 
models—are compiled for external, fiscal, corporate, and financial sectors. Second, each indicator is 
compared against a database of realized capital account crises to derive thresholds that minimize 
combined percentages of missed calls and false alarms. These differences in discriminatory powers 
(minimum sum of errors) are then used to provide guidance on weights for each indicator in the index 
for each of the sectors; these are then further combined into an aggregate index using judgment-based 
sector weights (text figure). Analysis thus generated is vetted by area departments, with country-
specific considerations used to generate final assessments. 
These indices provide a summary statistic of vulnerabilities. High correlations among many of 
these variables preclude simultaneous inclusion in regression analyses; an index, therefore, provides a 
snapshot of these features allowing further statistical analysis. A paper prepared for the IMF Board in 
2007, which updated the VEE methodology, generally uses the model-based external vulnerability 
index measure; indeed, it finds that external sector indicators perform the best in predicting past crises 
and allocates them the highest weight (45 percent) in constructing the overall vulnerability index.

Appendix 1. Country Sample 
 
This paper seeks to cover as wide a set of economies as possible, subject to data 
availability constraints. With no strict ex ante qualification or exclusion criteria applied, the 
empirical analysis attempts to use the largest possible country sample. As a result, 57 
economies are considered. The sample includes some countries that are classified as 
Advanced Economies (AEs) in the World Economic Outlook, but which are included in 
either the S&P IFCI or the S&P Frontier BMI emerging market stock indices. Nonetheless, 
owing to the variety of series and sources used, countries enter various regressions to the 
extent that relevant data for a particular specification are available. Thus, country samples 
differ throughout the paper.  
 
Data sources: The analysis is based on staff calculations using data from the Spring 2010 
World Economic Outlook and from internal staff assessment of vulnerabilities. Additionally, 
public sources (BIS, CEIC, Haver, IFS, Moody's, and others) are used.
