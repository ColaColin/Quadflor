Smaller Public Sectors in the Euro Area: 
Aggregate and Distributional Implications 
 
 
Abstract 
 
In this paper, we study the aggregate and distributional implications of a smaller public sector 
in the euro area. By a smaller public sector, we mean a reduction in public debt and/or cuts in 
public spending, when such changes in fiscal policy are accommodated by adjustment in 
various taxes. Aggregate implications have to do with per capita output and welfare, while 
distribution refers to differences in income and welfare between private and public sector 
employees. We solve the model numerically using fiscal data from the euro area and then do a 
number of policy experiments. The general message is that the issue is not just a smaller 
public sector, but also the spending-tax mix chosen.

1. Introduction  
   
Given the sharp rise in public debt in most countries after the financial and economic 
crisis in 2008-09, there are calls for extra fiscal consolidation measures.1 The latter 
are believed to be necessary because just improving the efficiency of the tax system, 
or waiting for growth to cyclically improve the debt dynamics, seems to be not 
enough. It is also believed that, especially in a period of protracted recession, 
consolidation measures should give a larger weight to spending cuts as opposed to tax 
increases.2 Thus, although this is not always explicitly admitted, lower public 
spending seems inevitable.      
In light of the above, in this paper, we study the aggregate and distributional 
implications of a smaller public sector. By a smaller public sector, we mean a 
reduction in public debt and/or cuts in public spending, when such changes in fiscal 
policy are accommodated by adjustment in various taxes. Aggregate implications 
have to do with per capita output and welfare, while distribution refers to differences 
in income and welfare between private and public employees. We choose to 
distinguish between private and public sector employees because the latter play a key 
role resisting most attempts to reform the public sector. It is thus important to look at 
the distributional implications of fiscal consolidation measures and, hopefully, find 
Pareto-improving ones. It is also important to find measures that reduce debt but do 
not endanger a macro recovery, at least in the medium- and long-run.       
To study the above issues, we build a micro-founded dynamic general 
equilibrium model with two distinct groups of households: those that work in the 
private sector and those that are employed in the public sector. The latter (called 
public employees), together with goods purchased from the private sector, are used as 
inputs in the government production function (for similar models see e.g. Finn, 1998, 
Cavallo, 2005, Ardagna, 2007, Pappa, 2009, and Economides et al., 2011). We solve 
the model numerically using fiscal data from the euro area. Then, departing from this 
status quo equilibrium, we study a number of changes in fiscal policy, where the 
focus is on the aggregate and distributional implications of cuts in (various categories 
of) public spending and a declining share of public debt, and how these implications 
                                                          
1 Fiscal consolidation means improvements in the budget balance through changes in fiscal policy. 
2 See European Commission (2011) for the current fiscal situation in Europe and fiscal consolidation 
measures taken.

depend on the public financing policy instrument. By public financing, we mean the 
tax instrument that adjusts to accommodate the exogenous changes in fiscal policy. 
We believe that these reforms can capture some of the main proposals currently under 
discussion in policy circles. 
When we compare lifetime utility under the status quo to lifetime utilities 
under various fiscal reforms, our main results are as follows.  
First, there is a policy mix that is Pareto superior to the status quo. In 
particular, both the aggregate economy and each social group can benefit relative to 
the status quo, if simultaneously: (a) we permanently reduce all categories of public 
spending as shares of output by 1%; (b) we gradually reduce public debt at 60% 
within a period of 10 to 15 years; and (c) we use the capital tax rate as the public 
financing instrument that accommodates these exogenous changes in fiscal policy. 
The latter means that capital tax rates increase in the short run during the debt 
consolidation phase but are reduced later on thanks to reduced spending and debt 
burden.   
Second, although the above policy mix is Pareto superior relative to the status 
quo, there is a conflict of interests between private and public employees when we 
compare alternative reform mixes. In particular, concerning the aggregate economy 
and private employees, the above mix - that includes a permanent reduction in public 
spending - is better than a mix that is based on debt consolidation only. This happens 
because taxes need to rise by less when we both cut public spending and reduce debt 
relative to the case where we reduce debt only. Hence, the recessionary effects of debt 
consolidation become milder when we also cut spending at the same time. On the 
other hand, public employees would prefer debt consolidation only, since a cut in 
public spending hurts their wages directly. All this holds irrespectively of which tax 
rate is used to stabilize public debt over time. 
Third, although the above mix is Pareto superior to the status quo during life 
time, it comes at a cost in the short-run. In particular, even if public spending is also 
cut permanently, reaction to debt imbalances necessitates higher taxes in the first 10-
15 years of debt consolidation, which hits the real economy. As a result, the 
consumption of both private and public sector employees (especially, of the latter) fall 
during the debt consolidation phase. Thus, there will be no support for a smaller 
public sector if agents are short-sighted, and this applies even to private agents. Again 
4 
 
all this holds in all cases irrespectively of the tax instrument used to react to public 
debt imbalances over time.  
Fourth, other things equal, it is better to use capital taxes rather than labour or 
consumption taxes to accommodate fiscal consolidation measures. This happens 
because when we use the capital tax rate to react to public debt imbalances in the 
short run, this works like an implicit tax or a capital levy on existing wealth. At the 
same time, public debt stabilization in the short run is translated into a reduced fiscal 
burden and expectations of lower capital taxes in the future, which in turn can 
stimulate investment. In other words, the standard capital levy mechanism of Judd 
(1985) and Chamley (1986) is important to both the efficiency and the long-run 
welfare gains from a smaller public sector (see also Altig et al., 2001, for the US). 
Thus, the general message is that the issue is not just a smaller public sector 
(in the form of a lower debt burden, lower public spending, or both), but also the 
spending-tax mix. The benefits of a smaller public sector are higher, or the costs are 
lower, when they are used to finance a reduction in capital taxes in the medium- and 
long-run. The latter generates strong supply-side effects that strengthen the beneficial 
effects, or mitigate the adverse effects, of spending cuts. 
Our work is related to several branches of the literature. First, it is related to 
the literature on debt consolidation (see e.g. Coenen et al., 2008, Forni et al., 2010, 
European Commission, 2010 and 2011, Papageorgiou, 2012, and Bi et al., 2012). This 
literature focuses on the best possible mix of spending cuts and tax rises. Here, 
instead, we take a smaller public sector as given, and study its aggregate and 
distributional implications. Second, our work is related to the more general literature 
on fiscal policy reforms. For instance, there is a rich literature on the implications of 
changes in the tax mix given spending (see e.g. Lucas, 1990, Cooley and Hansen, 
1992, McGrattan, 1994, Altig et al., 2001, and House and Shapiro, 2006, for the US, 
and Angelopoulos et al., 2012, for the UK). Here, we focus on a smaller size of the 
public sector and the choice of the public financing instrument. Economides et al. 
(2011) study a different type of public sector reform, namely, the delegation of public 
good provision to private providers, while Economides and Philippopoulos (2012) 
study the implications of replacing consumption taxes with user prices.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model 
economy. Section 3 presents the status quo solution. Section 4 studies various 
reforms. Section 5 closes the paper.  
   
2. The model economy  
 
The model used is the ?status quo? model in Economides et al. (2011). Consider a 
two-sector general equilibrium model in which private firms choose capital and 
labour supplied by private employees to produce a private good, while the 
government purchases part of the private good produced and hires public employees 
to produce a public good. The public good provides utility-enhancing services to all 
households. The private good is converted into the public good by a production 
function so that each is expressed in the same units. In order to finance total public 
spending, the government levies distorting taxes and issues bonds. Time is discrete 
and infinite. 
The population size at time t , tN , is exogenous. Among tN , there are 
1,2,..., ptp N=  identical households that work in the private sector and 1,2,...,
b
tb N=  
identical households that work in the public sector, where p bt t tN N N+ = . There are 
also 1,2,..., ftf N=  identical private firms. Each household employed in the private 
sector owns one private firm. The fraction of public employees in population,

where , ,? ? ?  are preference parameters. Thus, p gt tc Y?+  is composite consumption, 
where public goods and services influence private utility through the parameter ? .

2.3 Private firms producing the private good    
In each period, each private firm 1,2,..., ftf N=  chooses capital and labor inputs,

f f f p f

where, for our numerical solutions below, we use a production function of the form: 
 
1( ) ( )f f ft t ty A k e
? ??=                                                                                                      (8) 
 
where 0A >  and 0 1?< <  are technology parameters.    
In each period, each f  chooses ftk  and 
f
te  taking factor prices as given.   
 
2.4 Public sector   
We now present the public sector. We start with the government budget constraint 
and then specify the production function of public goods and services. 
 
2.4.1 Government budget constraint   
The period budget constraint of the government is (quantities are in aggregate terms 
are denoted by capital-letters):  
 
, ,
1(1 )
g w tr p tr b
t t t t t t t tG G G G B B T? ++ + + + + = +                                                              (9a) 
 
where gtG  is total public spending on goods and services purchased from the private 
sector; wtG  is the total public wage bill; 
,tr p
tG  and 
,tr b
tG  are respectively transfers to 
9 
 
private and public employees; tB  is the beginning-of-period total stock of government 
bonds; and tT  denotes total tax revenues defined as: 
( )c p p b bt t t t t tT N c N c?? + + [ ( ) ]
k p p p b b
t t t t t t t tN r k N rk? ?+ + ( )
l p p p b g b
t t t t t t tN w e N w e?+ +        (9b) 
 
Thus, as in Alesina et al. (2002), we include the three main types of government 
spending (purchases of goods and services from the private sector, public wages, and 
transfers to individuals). We also include the three main types of taxes (taxes on 
consumption, capital income and labor income). 
Inspection of (9a-b) implies that, in each time period, there are nine policy 
instruments ( , ,, , , ,g w tr p tr bt t t tG G G G
c
t? ,
k
t? , ,
l
t? 1,
b
t tB N+ ) out of which one needs to adjust 
to satisfy the government budget constraint. The choice of the adjusting public 
financing policy instrument is of key importance (see below). Following most of the 
related literature, we start by assuming that the adjusting instrument is the end-of-
period total public debt, 1tB + , so that the other eight policy instruments can be set 
exogenously by the government. 
For convenience, concerning spending policy instruments, we will work in 
terms of their GDP shares,

denotes total output (defined below). Similarly, concerning the number of public 
employees, we will work in terms of their population share,

2.4.2 Production function of public goods and services   
Following most of the related literature, we assume that total public goods and 
services, gtY , are produced using goods purchased from the private sector, 
g
tG , and 
public employment, gtL  (where, in equilibrium, 
g b b
t t tL N e= ). In particular, following 
e.g. Linnemann (2009), for our numerical solutions, we use a Cobb-Douglas 
production function of the form: 
 
1( ) ( )g g gt t tY A G L
? ??=                                                                                                   (10) 
 
10 
 
where 0 1?? ?  is a technology parameter. Notice that our modeling can nest most of 
the specifications used in the literature.4 Also notice that both private and public good 
production face the same TFP; this is because we do not want our results to be driven 
by exogenous factors.  
 
2.5 Decentralized competitive equilibrium (DCE) for any feasible policy  
Combining the above, we now solve for a DCE for any feasible fiscal policy. In this 
DCE: (i) all households maximize utility acting competitively, (ii) all firms in the 
private sector maximize profits acting competitively, (iii) all markets clear and (iv) all 
constraints are satisfied. As we show in the Appendix, the DCE is summarized by 14 
equilibrium equations. When , , 0{ , , , , , , , }

To close the model, we need to specify the exogenously set policy 
instruments. Denoting them as , ,( , , , , , , , )g w tr p tr b c k l bt t t t t t t t tx s s s s v? ? ?? , we will allow some of 
the policy instruments to respond systematically to debt imbalances (see also e.g. 
Forni et al., 2010, and many others, while a review of the literature on fiscal reaction 
functions can be found in European Commission, 2011). Thus, in general, we have:

where x  is the long-run value of the policy instrument, tt YB / , is the beginning-of-
period public debt-to-output ratio, YB /  is its long-run value,
5 10 ?? x?  is an 
autoregressive parameter and x?  is a feedback policy coefficient, which is positive if 
the policy instrument describes a tax rate and negative if the policy instrument 
describes public spending. Further details for each tax-spending policy instrument are 
provided below.6    
                                                          
4 For details and comparison to the literature, see Economides et al. (2011). Our qualitative results are 
not affected by the functional form used.   
5 When we study the transition to a reformed economy, these long-run values will be the reformed or 
targeted values, not the ones in the data; the latter will be the pre-reform or departing values. See 
below. 
6 The fraction of public employees, btv , will be kept constant at its average value in the data.

3. Parameterization, data and the status quo solution    
 
We present parameterization and then the long-run solution of the model economy 
above.  
 
3.1  Parameter values and policy instruments  
Table 1 reports the baseline parameter values for technology and preference, as well 
as the values of the exogenously set policy instruments, used to solve the model 
economy developed in section 2. The time unit is meant to be a year. Regarding 
parameters for technology and preference, we use relatively standard values used by 
the business cycle literature. Regarding fiscal policy variables, we use data averages 
of the Eurozone.    
 
Table 1 around here 
 
Let us briefly discuss the parameter and policy values summarized in Table 1. 
The labour share in the private production function, 1 ?? , is set at 0.601. The scale 
parameter in the technology function, A , is set at 1. The time preference rate, ? , is 
set at 0.96. The weight given to public goods and services in composite consumption, 
? , is set at 0.1, as is usually the case in similar studies. The other preference 
parameters related to hours of work, ?  and ? , are calibrated at 5 and 1 respectively; 
these parameter values imply hours of work within usual ranges. The capital 
depreciation rate, ? , is set at 0.05. The transaction cost parameter associated with 
participation in asset markets is set at , , , , 0.002p k p b b k b b? ? ? ?= = = =  across both 
agents and both assets. We report that our results are robust to changes in these 
parameter values. 
 In the baseline parameterization, the productivity of public employment vis-?-
vis the productivity of goods purchased from the private sector, in the public sector 
production function, 1 ?? , is set at 0.465. This value is the sample average of public 
wage payments, as share of total public spending on inputs used in the production of 
public goods (see also e.g. Linnemann, 2009, and Economides et al., 2011).      
12 
 
Public employees as a share of total population, b? , are set at 0.1602, which is 
the average data in the Eurozone over 1990-2008. The output shares of public 
spending on wage payments, wts , and on goods and services purchased from the 
private sector, gts , are respectively 0.1067 and 0.1224, again as implied by the data 
over the same period as above.7 The effective tax rates on consumption, capital and 
labor, ct? , 
k
t? and 
l
t? , are respectively 0.1936, 0.2882 and 0.3882, as in the average 
data for the euro zone over 1995-2008.8  
Total government transfers as a share of output, trts , are allowed to follow 
residually in the long run of the status quo economy so as to match the spending-tax 
data above and a public debt-to-output ratio, YB / , at 0.8; the latter is the average 
value in the data over the sample period. Regarding the allocation of total government 
transfers between the two population groups, we assume that they are allocated 
between private and public sector employees so as to match the observed in the data 
wage premium of public vis-?-vis private employees. According to recent empirical 
studies (see e.g. Giordano et al., 2011, Holm-Hadula et al., 2010, and Lamo et al., 
2008), this premium is considered to be on average around 10%. The same value has 
also been used by Ardagna (2007). As reported in Table 3 below, this 10% public 
wage premium, can happen when public employees enjoy a larger share of transfers 
than their fraction in population. 
Concerning the autoregressive policy parameters, 0 1x?? < , in the policy 
rules (11), their values depend on whether the particular policy instrument x  reacts to 
debt imbalances along the transition to the long run, namely, whether x?  is nonzero 
or zero. If a policy instrument reacts to debt imbalances along the transition (i.e. 
0x? ? ), so there is also an endogenous feedback component in (11), our simulations 
imply that the value of x?  needs to be relatively small to get local determinacy. In 
that case, we simply choose to set it at zero (we report however that our results do not 
change if we assume a low positive value of persistence). If, on the other hand, a 
policy instrument does not react to debt imbalances (i.e. 0x? = ), the value of x?  can 
                                                          
7 The data on public employees and various categories of public spending are from OECD Economic 
Outlook, vol. 90, 2011, and cover the period 1990 to 2008. 
8 The data on effective tax rates are from the database of Eurostat and cover the period 1995 to 2008. 
13 
 
take any value between 0 and 1 without creating indeterminacy problems. In 
particular, in our policy experiments below, reaction to debt imbalances over time 
takes place through adjustments in tax rates (interestingly, a similar reaction to debt 
through adjustment in the output share of public spending creates indeterminacy 
problems). Hence, concerning tax rates, we set 0x? =  in (11), while the value of the 
feedback policy coefficient, x? , is set so as to allow the reformed economy to 
approach the new long-run equilibrium public debt ratio within a period of 10-15 
periods or years. Concerning public spending shares, we set 0x? =  in (11), while the 
value of x?  depends on the type of reform we study. In the case of immediate and 
permanent spending cuts, we set 0=x?  in (11). In the case of gradual spending cuts, 
we choose to set 6.0=x? . See below for further details.   
 
3.2  The status quo, or benchmark, equilibrium 
Given the parameter and policy values in Table 1, the steady state solution of the 
model economy, called status quo, is reported in the first row of Table 3. Notice that 
the solution is well defined and the key ratios, like consumption and capital as shares 
of output, are close to their respective values in the data.   
 In what follows, departing from this status quo steady state solution, we study 
the implications of various exogenous changes in fiscal policy.   
 
4. Fiscal policy reforms  
 
We now study fiscal policy reforms. The aim is to study the aggregate and 
distributional implications of a smaller public sector.  
 
4.1  Reforms studied 
We find it convenient to work in two steps. The first step studies debt consolidation 
only. In particular, we reduce the output share of public debt at 0.60 at some point in 
time, say, in 10-15 periods after departing from the status quo (we choose the value of 
0.60 simply because it has been the reference value of the initial Maastricht Treaty). 
In turn, in the second step, we examine the more interesting case in which the same 
reduction in public debt is combined with a reduction in public spending. In 
14 
 
particular, each category of public spending is exogenously reduced by 1 percentage 
point of GDP vis-?-vis its average value in the data. Recall that here we employ three 
categories of public spending, namely, spending on public wages, on goods purchased 
from the private sector and on government transfers. In other words, total public 
spending as a share of output is cut by 3 percentage points. Actually, we will study 
two ways of spending cuts: a case in which these cuts take place immediately and 
permanently (known as cold-turkey strategy), and a case in which they happen 
gradually over time.9 Table 2 lists all policy reforms we study. As said above, in each 
reform studied, we depart from the same status quo long-run solution. Also, as said 
above, we do not allow public spending to react to debt imbalances over time 
because, in our model, this leads to indeterminacy problems.    
 
Table 2 around here 
 
As described in Table 2, we study five policy reforms. In Reform 1, the public 
debt to output ratio is gradually brought down to 60% (from 80% in the pre-reform 
status quo) along the transition to the new long run equilibrium. In Reforms 2 and 3, 
we study the same experiment as in Reform 1 but, in addition, we have spending cuts. 
The difference between Reform 2 and Reform 3 is that in the former spending cuts 
take place immediately, while in the latter they happen gradually over time. To get a 
clearer picture of what drives our results, we will also report results for the case in 
which only spending cuts take place, i.e. without debt consolidation. This is in 
Reforms 4 and 5. Again, the difference between Reform 4 and Reform 5 is that in the 
latter spending cuts take place gradually.  
 It is well recognized that the implications of exogenous fiscal changes like the 
above depend heavily on the public financing policy instrument used, namely, the 
policy instrument that adjusts endogenously to accommodate these exogenous 
changes in fiscal policy (see e.g. Leeper et al., 2010, and Leeper, 2010). Here we 
assume that, along the transition path, fiscal reforms are accommodated by 
adjustments in tax rates, namely, the tax rates on capital income, labour income and 
                                                          
9 As said above, in the case of immediate and permanent spending cuts, 0=x?  in (11). In the case of 
gradual spending cuts, we set 6.0=x? . The long run values x  is the same in both types of 
15 
 
private consumption. To understand the logic of our results, and following usual 
practice in related studies, we will experiment with one tax rate at a time. This means 
that, along the transition path, we allow one of the tax rates to react to public debt 
imbalances, so as to stabilize debt around its target rate of 0.60 in 10-15 time periods 
(or within a 10 to 15 years period), and that, in the new reformed long run, the same 
tax rate follows residually to close the government budget; all other tax rates, except 
the one used for debt stabilization, are set as in the data averages. This implies that, 
when used for debt stabilization, the feedback policy coefficients, x? , corresponding 
to labour, capital and consumption taxes are set at 1.1, 1.3 and 1.2 respectively.  
 
4.2  How we work 
We work as follows. We first solve and compare long-run equilibria with and without 
reforms. We then check that, when log-linearized around its steady state solution, 
each model economy studied is saddle-path stable. This is for each type of reform and 
each method of public financing. In turn, setting, as initial conditions for the state 
variables, their steady state solution of the status quo economy, we compute the 
equilibrium transition path of each reformed economy and in turn calculate the 
associated discounted lifetime utilities of the two types of households as well as the 
resulting per capita lifetime utility. These utilities are finally compared to their 
associated values if we had remained in the status quo economy for ever. In other 
words, we work as in e.g. Lucas (1990), Cooley and Hansen (1992) and Mendoza and 
Tesar (1998). Recall that the model is deterministic so that the only source of 
transitional dynamics is that we depart from a pre reform steady state that differs from 
the new reformed one.     
 
4.3 Long-run results 
Table 3 presents the long-run solutions for the pre-reform status quo economy and all 
reformed economies. Notice that since reforms 2 and 3 on the one hand, and 4 and 5 
on the other hand, differ only in the transition, their long-run solutions are identical. 
In each reform, we report results for each public financing case; thus, when the labor 
                                                                                                                                                                      
experiments and it is less by one percentage point relative to the data average. Recall that for spending 
rules, 0=x? , in all experiments.   
16 
 
tax rate, l? , or the capital tax rate, k? , or the consumption tax rate, c? , endogenously 
adjusts to satisfy the government budget constraint.10 
Reform 1 (i.e. debt reduction) is trivial in the long run. This is because, if we 
focus on the long run only, a reduction in public debt is like a free lunch. Other things 
equal, such a reduction implies a lower debt burden which releases resources for other 
types of spending and/or allows tax cuts. Therefore, in the long run, we are interested 
in Reforms 2-5 that include cuts in public spending.     
 
Table 3 around here 
 
Inspection of the long-run results for Reforms 2-5 in Table 3 reveals the 
following. Households working in the private sector always benefit from a smaller 
public sector accompanied by lower taxes. This happens in all cases, irrespectively of 
how a smaller public sector is achieved (lower public spending, lower public debt, or 
a combination of both) and the tax instrument used to accommodate this fiscal 
consolidation. The same applies to the aggregate economy (see per capita values). 
That is, the ?general public? always gains from a smaller public sector. Public 
employees, on the other hand, can benefit or lose depending on the form of fiscal 
consolidation and the public financing policy instrument used. Nevertheless, our 
solutions imply that there is a mix of policy changes that benefits public employees 
too and hence is Pareto superior to the status quo. In particular, a comparison of the 
long-run solution under the status quo to the long-run solutions under various fiscal 
reforms implies that an exogenous reduction in public debt at 60%, combined with an 
exogenous horizontal cut by 1% in all three categories of public spending, is Pareto 
superior to the status quo, if these reductions are compensated with an endogenous 
reduction in the capital tax rate.11 
In other words, in the long run, a smaller public sector can be beneficial not 
only to the aggregate economy but also to each social group separately, to the extent 
that lower public spending (on the debt burden and the other categories of public 
spending) is used to finance lower capital taxes. The latter are particularly distorting

in the long run so that their reduction enhances aggregate efficiency and this proves to 
be good for both income groups (this is consistent with the normative results of 
Chamley, 1986, and especially Judd, 1985, for long-run capital taxation).  
We report that we have experimented with changes in the parameter values 
and all the above are rather robust results.  
 
4.4 Transition results 
We next study what happens when we depart from the pre-reform economy, where 
fiscal policy variables are as in the data, and travel towards a new long-run according 
to the type of reform we perform. Now, in contrast to the long-run analysis above, 
debt consolidation is expected to be costly, since the reduction in the end-of-period 
debt over time requires higher taxes during the debt consolidation phase. As discussed 
above, during the transition, total public debt is modelled as an endogenous variable, 
while one of the tax rates reacts to deviations of debt from its target value of 0.6, with 
the associated feedback policy coefficient calibrated in such a way so as to bring 
down the end-of-period public debt from its 0.8 pre-reform value to its targeted 0.6 
value within a period of 10 to 15 years.  
Results for discounted lifetime utility of the two agents, denoted as pU  and 
bU , as well as per capita discounted lifetime utility, denoted as U , are reported in 
Tables 4a, 4b and 4c. These three tables correspond to the case in which the policy 
instrument used for debt stabilization is the labor tax rate, the capital tax rate and the 
consumption tax rate respectively. To better understand the logic of our results, we 
also provide impulse response functions for the key macroeconomic variables in each 
reform studied. These are Figures 1a-e, 2a-e and 3a-e which correspond to the three 
tax rates used for debt stabilization.    
 
Tables 4a, 4b and 4c around here 
Figures 1a-e, 2a-e and 3a-e around here 
 
Inspection of Tables 4a-c and Figures 1a-c reveals that, as it was the case in 
the long run, households working in the private sector, as well as the aggregate 
                                                                                                                                                                      
11 Actually, notice that this mix of reforms is not only Pareto superior but is also the most preferred one 
from the point of view of both groups of agents - see however below for lifetime utility.   
18 
 
economy, always benefit from a smaller public sector accompanied by lower taxes, 
while effects on the lifetime utility of households working in the public sector 
depends on the policy reform mix chosen. Nevertheless, there is a policy mix that is 
Pareto superior to the status quo and this policy mix is similar to the most preferred 
one in the long-run analysis above. In particular, both the aggregate economy and 
each social group can benefit relative to the status quo, if we permanently reduce all 
three categories of public spending by 1%, gradually reduce public debt at 60% 
within a period of 10 to 15 years, and use the capital tax rate as the public financing 
instrument that reacts to public debt imbalances over the transition to the new long 
run. 
However, there are two problems associated with this policy mix. First, 
although the above policy mix is Pareto superior relative to the status quo, there is a 
conflict of interests between private and public employees when we compare 
alternative reform mixes. In particular, concerning the aggregate economy and private 
employees, the above mix - that includes a permanent reduction in public spending - 
is better than a mix that is based on debt consolidation only (this holds irrespectively 
of which tax rate is used to stabilize debt imbalances over time). This happens 
because taxes need to rise by less when we both cut public spending and reduce debt 
relative to the case where we reduce debt only. Hence, the recessionary effects of debt 
consolidation become milder when we also cut spending at the same time. On the 
other hand, public employees would prefer debt consolidation only, since a cut in 
public spending hurts their wages directly (again this holds irrespectively of which 
tax rate is used to stabilize debt over time). 
Second, although the above mix is Pareto superior during life time, it comes at 
a cost in the short-run. In particular, even if public spending is also cut permanently, 
reaction to debt imbalances necessitates higher taxes in the first 10 years of debt 
consolidation, which hits the real economy. As a result, the consumption of both 
private and public employees (especially, of the latter) fall during the debt 
consolidation phase. Results for discounted utility in the first ten periods after the 
reform is enacted when the capital tax rate is the residual policy instrument are 
reported in Table 5, where we also report the related utility if we had remained in the 
status quo for ten periods.  
 
19 
 
Table 5 around here 
 
Thus, there will be no support for a smaller public sector if agents are short-sighted, 
and this applies even to private agents. Notice that all this happens in all cases 
irrespectively of the tax instrument used to react to public debt imbalances over time. 
Two further features of the solution are also interesting. First, our impulse 
response functions imply that the reform effects on output differ depending on the tax 
instrument used. Output falls in the short- and medium-run during the debt 
consolidation phase if we use consumption and especially labor taxes to react to debt. 
By contrast, output does not seem to suffer if we use capital taxes. This is for a 
number of reasons, for instance: the capital levy mechanism (see right below for 
details); labor supply rises because the fall in consumption and leisure push 
employees to work. 
Second, other things equal, it is better to use capital taxes rather than labour 
and consumption taxes to react to public debt imbalances over time.12 This happens 
because when we use the capital tax rate to react to public debt imbalances in the 
short run, this works like an implicit tax or a capital levy on existing wealth. At the 
same time, public debt stabilization in the short run is translated into a reduced fiscal 
burden and expectations of lower capital taxes in the future, which can stimulate 
investment. In other words, the standard capital levy mechanism is important to both 
the efficiency and the long-run welfare gains from a smaller public sector (see also 
Altig et al., 2001, for the US). 
 
5. Conclusions and possible extensions 
 
This paper has studied the aggregate and distributional implications of a smaller 
public sector in the euro area. In general, the model predicts medium- and long-run 
output and welfare benefits from a smaller public sector associated with lower taxes. 
But, looking at lifetime utilities, such reforms can come at the expense of some 
groups, in particular, public employees. Besides, such reforms are costly for all 
groups, including private employees, in the short-run. Thus, as usually, the answer to 
                                                          
12 This applies to both groups including public employees; the latter are worse off when the 
government uses labour taxes or consumption taxes, instead of capital taxes, to react to public debt 
imbalances over time. 
20 
 
the question ?are such reforms worth it?? requires a value judgement (see also Altig et 
al., 2001).  
Our work can be extended in several ways. First, it would be interesting to 
allow for substitutability between public employment and goods purchased from the 
private sector in the production function of public goods. Second, here public and 
private sector employees differed in their role of production only. But it is widely 
recognized that they can differ in many other ways. For instance, we could introduce 
politico-economy issues, such as extra benefits on the part of public employees 
coming from rent seeking. Third, we could allow for unemployment and hence add a 
third socio-economic group of households, the unemployed, whose size is 
endogenously determined. Finally, here we focused on the implications of some 
policy reforms that seem to be consistent with observed fiscal consolidation policies 
and/or proposals currently under discussion in policy circles. But we have not 
attempted to study optimal (time-consistent) policy and compare this to our 
exogenous policy changes. We leave these extensions for future work.

Equations (A.1-A.3) and (A.5-A.7) are the optimality conditions of private and 
public employees respectively, with respect to labor, savings in capital and savings in 
bonds. Equations (A.4), (A.10) and (A.11) are the three linearly independent budget 
constraints (private employees?, the government?s and the economy?s resource 
constraint). Equations (A.8) and (A.9) are the production functions for the private and
