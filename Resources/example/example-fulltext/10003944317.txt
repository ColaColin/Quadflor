 Executive Summary 
 
Economic background. Belarus is beginning to emerge from the crisis. Output loss has been 
limited relative to neighbors, inflation has fallen, the foreign exchange market has stabilized, 
and de-dollarization is underway, likely a sign of returning confidence. However, the economy 
remains vulnerable to external shocks. The current account deficit remains high and reserves 
low, despite substantial support, including from the Fund.  
Program discussions. Program performance since the last review has been good: all 
quantitative and continuous performance criteria and structural benchmarks for end-September 
were met. The authorities have taken measures—including exchange rate movement and fiscal 
adjustment—to close a financing gap during the program period created by a shortfall in 
external financing. They request a modification of the NIR and NDA targets for end-December 
since the exchange rate movement will have effects mostly in 2010. The staff supports this 
request. The authorities have also agreed with the staff on a macroeconomic framework 
for 2010 underpinned by prudent fiscal policy and restrained credit policy. Staff recommends 
completion of the third review of the SBA, with a modification of the end-December NIR and 
NDA performance criteria. 
 
Discussions were held in Minsk during November 10–19, 2009. The staff team comprised 
Messrs. Jarvis (head), Ding, Kovtun (all EUR), Prokopenko (MCM), Turunen (SPR), and 
Wane (FAD). The team met the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Kobyakov; the Governor of the 
National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB), Mr. Prokopovich; the Minister of Finance, 
Mr. Kharkovets; the Minister of Economy, Mr. Zaichenko; the Deputy Head of the Presidential 
Administration, Mr. Anfimov, and other senior officials. Mr. Prader (OED) participated in the 
final discussions. Ms. Koliadina, the Resident Representative, assisted the mission.

I.   CONTEXT: PROGRAM ACHIEVEMENTS AND ECONOMIC PROSPECTS 
1.      Almost a year after adoption of a Fund-supported program, Belarus’s economy 
is stabilizing and growth is set to resume, but the economy remains vulnerable to 
external shocks. Belarus has avoided the worst consequences of the global economic crisis. 
Growth prospects are improving, and inflation has fallen, notwithstanding a devaluation at 
the beginning of 2009 which corrected an exchange rate overvaluation. However, the current 
account deficit remains stubbornly high, and reserves low, despite substantial support, 
including from the Fund. 
2.      Discussions on the third review of the SBA focused on policies that would 
consolidate the progress made so far and address the remaining weaknesses. The 
authorities have taken measures to close a financing gap during the program period created 
by a shortfall in external financing. They have also agreed with the staff on a macroeconomic 
framework for 2010 that emphasizes macroeconomic stability and a return to modest growth. 
The authorities see scope for growth to be higher—and have prepared an ambitious “target 
scenario” embodying this goal. But they were responsive to warnings from the staff that 
achieving high and sustainable growth will depend on policies supportive of macroeconomic 
stability, on structural reforms that are not yet fully specified, and on external developments 
beyond their control. They therefore accept they need to give priority in monetary and fiscal 
policy to stabilization and increasing international reserves. Policies to achieve these 
objectives are set out in the attached Letter of Intent (LOI). The authorities are continuing to 
consider a successor Fund arrangement, but will defer a decision on whether to request Fund 
financial support until the external financing position for 2010 is clearer. 
II.   RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 
3.      Economic developments during the past two months have largely followed the 
course described at the time of the second review of the SBA in October. Belarus 
continues to avoid the sharp fall in output that has hit most of its neighbors. The current 
account deficit has increased further, though the third quarter saw some improvement in both 
the current and financial accounts, and an increase in reserves. Fiscal policy remains 
supportive of the needed macroeconomic adjustment. Commercial banks remain sound, 
though there is a growing liquidity problem in the largest state-owned banks. These 
developments are described in more detail below (Tables 1–5 and 8). 
 GDP declined by 1.0 percent year-on-year through October 2009, as strong growth in 
fixed investment—owing mainly to housing construction financed under government 
programs—offset the weakness in consumption and external demand. The economy 
is projected to contract slightly for the year. Reflecting slack in the economy and 
weak international prices, twelve-month CPI inflation eased from 15 percent early in 
the year to about 11 percent in October, and is expected to fall further to just above 
10 percent by year-end.

 Annual credit growth decelerated to 30 percent in October, due to the authorities’ 
efforts to rein in loans under government programs. However, it is too early to tell 
whether these efforts will be sufficient to keep the increase in credit under 
government programs below the level agreed at the time of the second review. 1  
 Recent data point to improved export volumes, but due to a deterioration in the terms 
of trade the current account deficit is now projected to reach $5.4 billion (11 percent 
of GDP) during 2009.  
 The financial account has improved. Reflecting improved confidence, since July 
households have sold some $35 million per month of the foreign currency they 
purchased in the first half of 2009 and the share of ruble deposits in total deposits has 
increased, and the share of foreign currency deposits in total deposits declined from 
nearly 56 percent in June to 51.7 percent in October.2 Corporations have been more 
successful in rolling over short-term debt.
                                                 
1 During the second review, the authorities agreed to limit net lending under government programs to 4 trillion 
rubels (2.9 percent of GDP) in the second half of 2009. 
2 Since May 2009 the authorities have also taken a number of administrative measures to promote de-
dollarization of the economy and limit foreign exchange outflows. According to the staff’s analysis based on 
review of the documents and discussions with the authorities, these measures do not give rise to exchange 
restrictions or multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, Section 2. Staff will 
continue to review these measures for jurisdictional implications and to monitor developments.  
5 
 
  External financing of the program remains largely as expected at the time of the 
second review. The World Bank Board approved a $200 million Development Policy 
Loan on December 1. The European Commission is still planning to support Belarus 
through its macrofinancial assistance policy. However, there have been delays in 
processing the loan, and due to changes in 
procedure following the ratification of the 
Lisbon Treaty, it is increasingly likely that 
the disbursement (about $290 million) will 
only take place during the first quarter 
of 2010. Russia is no longer committed to 
providing the final $500 million tranche of 
a bilateral loan, creating a financing gap. 
The authorities are continuing to pursue 
financial support through the Eurasian 
Economic Community Anti-Crisis-Fund 
and are also discussing with commercial 
banks a possible loan of $300 million. 
However, given the uncertainty about these sources of finance the authorities will 
implement contingency measures and request a modification of the end-December 
performance criteria. Gross reserves increased to $4.6 billion at end-November, 
reflecting Fund disbursements and policy adjustment, and are projected to reach the 
revised program target of $5.6 billion by end-December, 20093. 
 Local governments’ fiscal position deteriorated significantly from a large surplus 
in 2008 to a deficit of 0.9 percent of GDP as of end-September. However, the general 
government budget was kept on track by cuts in central government spending on non-
priority goods and services and investment. The government also continued to pursue 
a tight wage policy, deciding not to increase wages in 2009. 
 Financial soundness indicators as of end-September 2009 remained broadly 
satisfactory and similar to their level as of end-June 2009, though liquidity indicators 
continued to deteriorate (Table 6). Stress test results (Box 1) show that banks have 
sufficient capital buffers to withstand a variety of risks but the liquidity condition of 
the large state-owned banks is weak, reflecting the significant involvement of these 
banks in lending under government programs. 
                                                 
3 Staff projections assume that the EU financial support of $290 million will be disbursed in December and that 
no loan from commercial banks will materialize. If the EU support is delayed until early 2010 and no offsetting 
additional disbursements are made the NIR target would be automatically adjusted downward and the NDA 
target adjusted upward. Hence no modification of performance criteria is needed for this possible shortfall.

Box 1. Banking System Stress Tests 
Stress test results based on end-September 2009 data are very similar to those based on the end-June 2009 
data: the relatively high capitalization allows banks to withstand a variety of shocks but vulnerability to 
liquidity risk remains a concern. 
The aggregate capital adequacy ratio as of end-September 2009 stood at19.0 percent (as compared 
to 19.1 percent at end-June 2009), which is over two times higher than the prudential minimum of 
8 percent, allowing banks to remain adequately capitalized in the event of assumed stress test scenarios. As 
in the past, state-owned banks are relatively more vulnerable to various risks, given their relatively low 
capitalization level, compared to that of foreign or private banks. 
The results of liquidity stress tests are cause for concern. In the event of a hypothetical 20 percent 
withdrawal of client liabilities, state-owned banks as well as the largest banks would end up with the 
current liquidity ratio below the statutory minimum of 70 percent. The vulnerability of state-owned banks 
to liquidity risk has been evident in stress tests in the past, and stems from the significant involvement of 
these banks in lending under government programs, and the imposition of limits on credit under 
government programs will help to reduce this vulnerability.

4.      Program performance has been good.  
 All quantitative and continuous performance criteria for end-September were met. 
NIR exceeded the target by $150 million, and NDA was nearly 0.5 trillion rubels 
below the ceiling. Given the shortfall in external budget support, the authorities 
delivered a smaller fiscal deficit to meet the adjusted fiscal target. 
 The authorities have refrained from introducing new government lending programs 
and the NBRB is limiting credit under government programs. Structural benchmarks 
relating to loan classification and provisioning and to privatization were met.  
 The authorities postponed an increase in tariffs on households' utilities and 
transportation until 2010 after making the decision not to increase wages in the 
budgetary sector in 2009. The NBRB stopped new lending to banks at below the 
market rate except for housing construction, as agreed in the previous LOI, and under 
commitments made before signing the previous LOI. 
III.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON THE PROGRAM FOR 2009 
5.       Policy discussions focused on measures to close the financing gap during the 
remainder of the program period. In response to the shortfall in external budget financing 
($500 million), the authorities are following through on the package of contingency measures 
agreed at the time of the second review. The government will maintain the fiscal savings 
achieved through difficult spending cuts in the third quarter and will backload spending 
in 2010. Despite its concerns about the 
effects of a further rapid depreciation of 
the rubel on confidence, the NBRB has 
allowed the value of the rubel to move 
close to the bottom of the current band. 
The NBRB has also converted some 
national assets not considered 
sufficiently liquid to be part of reserves 
under the program definition to more 
liquid assets. These measures are 
expected to increase gross reserves by 
about $350 million during 2009 
($150 million short of the target for 
end-December) and by the full 
$500 million during the program 
period, and will also reduce the full–
year 2010 financing gap.

6.      Tight fiscal policy will play an important part in helping the government to meet 
its end-December adjusted target. The government will carry over savings in spending on 
goods and services and investment made during the third quarter. Further postponement of 
wage increases to next year will more than offset the impact of the delay in raising fees for 
utilities and transportation. In 2009, local budgets’ deficits will be contained by reducing 
transfers from the central government, and a new duty on potassium exports will increase 
revenue.  
7.       The recent exchange rate depreciation will improve competitiveness and help 
close the financing gap, and the forthcoming shift in the central parity of the basket 
provides scope for further flexibility if needed. The authorities made good use of the 
flexibility embedded in the exchange rate band in November and early December, 
depreciating the currency to 8⅛ percent below the central parity of the basket, thus bringing 
it to a level close to the bottom of the band. They also announced their intention to re-center 
the band at the exchange rate level of end-December 2009, and reaffirmed their intention to 
maintain the ±10 percent band (Box 2). The 
incremental move, together with beneficial effects 
from the recent appreciation of the Russian ruble 
within the basket, will contribute to closing the 
financing gap during the remainder of the program 
period and improve Belarus’s external 
competitiveness in both 2009 and 2010. Assuming 
implementation of the policies agreed in the LOI, 
the current exchange rate appears to be in line with 
the medium-term equilibrium. The recentering of 
the band will give the authorities more flexibility 
in responding to any external shocks.

Box 2. The Exchange Rate Regime in Belarus 
Throughout the program period the authorities have worked to achieve a balance between the exchange 
rate flexibility needed to reduce external vulnerabilities and the stability needed to maintain confidence 
in the regime. At the beginning of 2009, the exchange rate was devalued by 20 percent against the US 
dollar and the peg to the US dollar was replaced with the peg to a basket of currencies consisting of the 
Russian ruble, the US dollar, and the Euro, with a possibility of fluctuation within a ±5 percent band 
around the central parity calculated as a geometric average of the respective exchange rates. The new 
exchange rate regime reflected Belarus’ structure of trade and financial flows. The shift to the basket 
and the adoption of a band around the central parity provided some degree of flexibility and stability, 
much needed in face of uncertainties posed by the global economic crisis. 
At intervals during the year, the authorities have been prepared to take advantage of the flexibility 
provided by the band and fine-tune the regime to respond to the turbulent external environment, 
although the speed and the extent of adjustments have been influenced by their strong preference for 
minimizing variability of the rubel against the US dollar. In order to calm the markets in January, the 
authorities limited the depreciation against the US dollar, pushing the rubel to the upper end of the 
band. However, continued exchange rate pressures felt in the first half of 2009 called for a gradual slide 
of the rubel against the parity, reaching the lower end of 
the ±5 percent band by mid-June. In order to preserve a 
buffer for further adjustments, the authorities widened 
the band to ±10 percent. 
The need to close the financing gap as well as the need 
to contain the current account deficit called for yet 
another movement of the rubel within a widened band in 
November-December. To maintain scope for flexibility 
in 2010 the authorities have also decided to recenter the 
band at its end-December 2009 level, which is expected 
to be about 8 percent below the originally set parity.

8.      The authorities have taken steps to slow down growth of lending under 
government programs, but the outcomes of their policies are not yet clear. The 
authorities scaled back their original lending plan for 2009, but by less than was envisaged at 
the time of the second review. However, new lending under government programs fell in 
October, suggesting that banks’ lending is still likely to be kept under the limit. 
IV.   POLICY DISCUSSIONS FOR 2010  
A.   Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks 
9.      Based on the policies described in the LOI, the economy will resume growth in 
2010, and the external current account will improve significantly. The authorities have 
committed to maintain prudent fiscal and monetary policies and a flexible exchange rate 
policy. With the fiscal deficit similar to that of 2009 (1.7 percent of GDP), credit increase in 
line with nominal GDP (13–15 percent), a gradual recovery of external demand (especially 
faster growth of demand in Russia than was expected at the time of the second review), and 
expected improvement in the terms of trade, GDP is expected to grow by 3¾ percent, 
inflation to fall to around 8 percent, and the current account deficit to narrow to around 
7 percent of GDP. Gross reserves will reach $7.2 billion, or over 2½ months of imports, but 
will still be lower than the end-2010 level targeted in the original program by about 
$1.5 billion (Table 7).4 The financing gap for 2010 beyond the program period could be filled 
by additional financial support from the Fund if a successor arrangement is agreed, financing 
from other multilateral donors, and possibly issuance of a Eurobond5. Over the medium term, 
renewed momentum to liberalize the economy—supported by efforts to maintain 
macroeconomic stability—will allow the authorities to resume high economic growth 
(around 7 percent), while reducing further the current account deficit and accumulating a 
comfortable level of reserves (3.3 months of imports). 
10.      The main risk to the outlook is that there could be a premature loosening of 
policies, especially once the program expires. Some policymakers would prefer to target a 
much higher rate of growth, seeking to fulfill the goals of the five-year plan adopted in 2006 
and to increase living standards. Upcoming elections for local governments (in spring 2010) 
and for the presidency (in early 2011) are likely to add to pressures on the authorities. The 
staff cautioned that an expansionary policy stance based on overly optimistic assumptions 
that involves large wage increases, stepped up investment, and higher credit could push up 
                                                 
4 The original program targeted a gross reserves level of about $8.1 billion for 2010. This target was adjusted 
upward to about $8.7 billion due to the SDR allocations in 2009. 
5 The authorities are also considering seeking a loan from commercial banks to bridge to a Eurobond issue (the 
possible $300 million commercial bank loan mentioned in paragraph 3). Belarus government bonds are rated B1 
with stable outlook by Moody’s, and B+ with negative outlook by Standard & Poor’s, both below investment 
grade. 
  11  
 
growth in the short run, but would lead to a much worse balance of payments and reverse the 
gains in reducing external vulnerability. The authorities accepted that policies need to remain 
disciplined through the program period, and main counterparts recognized that priority needs 
to be given to maintaining external stability throughout 2010. 
11.      Substantial uncertainty remains about external sector prospects. The pace of 
Belarus’s recovery would suffer from lower than projected growth in other countries, 
especially Russia (the main destination for Belarus’s non-oil exports). Additional downside 
risks are that energy import prices could be higher than projected and that trade relations with 
Russia may become strained as the countries negotiate on establishing a customs union and 
related economic issues. However, the environment for external financing could be better 
than is currently assumed, especially if Belarus continues with strong implementation of the 
program.  
B.   Credit and Monetary Policies 
12.      Slowing down credit growth will be a key element of the adjustment effort 
in 2010. The staff cautioned against too rapid expansion of credit in order to lower risks to 
the current account, and emphasized the need to free up credit for the private sector, which 
will be the main engine of job creation during the anticipated process of transition. The staff 
proposed a reduction in the share of lending under government programs to 46 percent of 
total claims on the economy by end-2010, implying an increase in lending under government 
programs of no more than 3¼ trillion rubels.6 The authorities accepted this logic, while 
noting a preference for a more rapid expansion of credit to the economy, including under 
government programs, if foreign financing (especially foreign direct investment) is available 
to support it. 
13.      Success in containing credit under government programs should make it 
possible to gradually ease interest rates in the credit markets. The authorities have been 
concerned for some time that the high level of real market interest rates imposes a burden on 
the real sector. (The real average interbank interest rate was 9 percent in October.) They 
recognized, however, that reducing interest rates can only be done if it would not 
compromise the objectives of the program. Given the high level of real rubel interest rates as 
well as the signs of stabilization (e.g. continued sales of foreign exchange by households and 
rising share of ruble deposits in total deposits), the staff agreed with the authorities that there 
was scope for a 50 basis points reduction in the policy rates, while recommending a delay in

to make this change from December 1. The NBRB agreed that further reductions in interest

rates should depend on progress in meeting reserve targets, continued dedollarization, and the 
success of the authorities’ efforts to limit credit under government programs.

C.   Fiscal Policy 
14.      The 2010 budget, submitted to Parliament by the President and expected to be 
signed into law by end-December 2009, is consistent with macroeconomic stability. Its 
deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP will add little to public debt and will free up resources for the 
private sector. Domestically-financed local budget deficits will be contained by a new 
provision that limits them to 1 percent of local governments’ revenue (about 0.1 percent of 
GDP). Tax revenue will be reduced by 1.2 percent of GDP. The impact of the elimination of 
several taxes (2½ percent of GDP) will be partly offset by an increase of 2 percentage points 
of the VAT to 20 percent (1 percent of GDP). Expenditures will be reduced by 1.4 percent of 
GDP, through a reduction of untargeted subsidies, and efforts to streamline the public 
investment program and contain net lending. Increases in fees for utilities (13 percent)) and 
transportation (18 percent) will be implemented to mitigate the impact of energy price 
increases on cost recovery levels. With the approval of the decree to reform targeted social 
assistance, this spending will double in 2010 and help mitigate the effects of the crisis on the 
needy. 
15.      The authorities remain committed to prudent income policies to safeguard 
Belarus’ competitiveness. In 2009, to contain domestic demand and reduce risks of 
macroeconomic instability, civil servants and workers of companies receiving public 
resources were not granted any salary increase. For 2010, the increase in the wage bill of the 
budgetary sector will be limited to 11 percent, and wages will be increased by no more than 
5 percent in the first quarter of 2010. Further increases—within the budget envelope—will be 
considered if macroeconomic conditions permit. As in 2009, wage setting in state enterprises 
receiving support from the government will also continue to be governed by wage policy for 
civil servants. 
  13  
 
16.      Medium-term fiscal policy will be geared toward further reducing the tax 
burden and the size of government, and will be supported by IMF Technical Assistance. 
Over the medium term, the authorities plan to further reduce taxes and to cut spending, 
especially on subsidies and transfers, which remains the largest item in the budget. The 
authorities have requested technical assistance from the IMF to help deliver these outcomes. 
D.   Financial Sector Issues 
17.      The mission agreed with the authorities on the remit of a special agency that will 
assume the role currently played by banks in financing government programs. A draft 
Decree on establishing the agency will be submitted to the President by end-December 2009, 
and the agency will start functioning in 2010. Initially, the functions of the agency will be 
limited to management of all already disbursed loans under government programs, with all 
assets and liabilities relating to lending under government programs being transferred to the 
new agency except for those relating to commercially viable loans that banks wish to retain. 
The volume of loans to be taken over will be substantial (the current stock of lending under 
government programs is 30.2 trillion rubels, equivalent to about 22 percent of GDP), and is 
expected to improve the liquidity position of state-owned banks. In light of the upcoming 
establishment of the agency, the authorities agreed to defer any recapitalization of state-
owned banks. During 2011 the agency is expected to take over distribution of all new 
government program loans, with all new lending included in the budget above the line.  
18.       The establishment of the agency will also allow the NBRB to terminate bank 
refinancing on non-market terms. There was agreement that such refinancing is distortive 
and should be phased out. The weighted average interest rate charged on this type of 
refinancing was 9.4 percent in October 2009, compared to the rate on standard refinancing 
facilities (mainly Lombard and repos) of 21.3 percent. The NBRB agreed not to extend any 
new refinancing to banks on non-market terms. However, until the agency is established, the 
NBRB will roll-over maturing loans which 
were issued to back specific government 
program loans with longer maturities. 
(These account for most outstanding 
NBRB credit.) The outstanding stock of 
non-market-based lending will not exceed 
8 trillion rubels, which corresponds to 
7 trillion rubels of disbursed loans and 
1 trillion rubels of already committed 
disbursements. The staff also emphasized 
the need for the NBRB to adopt a 
formalized framework for provision of 
emergency liquidity assistance to banks, in

line with the 2009 FSSA recommendations.7 
19.      Staff endorsed the intention of the authorities to continue implementing 
structural measures in the financial sector. 
 Loan classification and provisioning. Following the September 2009 amendments to 
the regulation on loan classification and provisioning, in line with the MCM TA 
recommendations, the NBRB and banks are conducting an assessment of the 
quantitative impact of the new regulations on bank soundness indicators.  
 NBRB independence. As part of the program conditionality, the NBRB has recently 
prepared a draft Presidential Decree which envisages significant changes to its 
governance structure, including by removing representatives of both the government 
and the banking sector from its governing body. A joint LEG/MCM TA mission is 
expected to take place in February 2010 to assist the authorities in addressing 
remaining issues in drafting this legislation before submitting it to the President. 
 Disengaging NBRB from non-core business. The NBRB’s expects the increase in 
equity holdings and financing of non-core business entities to be kept within the limit 
of 350 billion rubels for 2009, which was set under the original program to allow 
completion of restructuring of the non-core business entities owned by the NBRB. 
Such financing will be discontinued from 2010. The authorities are preparing a plan 
to sell all NBRB non-financial subsidiaries and associated companies. 
 Bank privatization. Some progress has been achieved with respect to bank 
privatization. An independent evaluation of Belpromstroibank, the third largest state-
owned bank in the country, has been completed in September. Following this 
evaluation, an agreement was reached to sell this bank to the Russian Sberbank for 
about US$300 million. 
E.   Other Structural Reforms 
20.      The authorities have made tangible progress in developing legal and institutional 
frameworks for privatization and reaffirmed their commitment to privatizing selected 
companies in 2010. The draft Privatization Law and the draft decree on establishing a 
privatization agency incorporating comments from the World Bank were submitted to 
Parliament and the President, respectively, on September 30, 2009. A list of five enterprises 
selected as candidates for privatization has been submitted to the President for approval. The 
controlling equity stakes of these companies will be offered for sale through an open, 
international, transparent, and competitive tender by end-February, 2010. Furthermore, by 
                                                 
7 MCM provided technical assistance in this area. 
  15  
 
the same date, the authorities will compile a further list of companies slated for privatization 
and charge the privatization agency, after it becomes operational, with preparing these 
enterprises for privatization through an open, international, transparent and competitive 
bidding process. 
21.      The government is gradually easing administrative controls. The authorities have 
refrained from the imposition of a general ceiling on monthly price increases. In consultation 
with the World Bank the authorities further alleviated administrative price controls by 
removing the restrictions on retail trade margins, except for a limited number of goods, and 
eliminating requirements for price registration. However, the economy remains heavily 
regulated, and use of mandatory targets is widespread. Beginning from 2010 the mandatory 
quantitative economic targets including those for output and employment will be abolished 
for the companies that do not benefit from government financial support and in which the 
government has a minority share.  
22.      The authorities and staff discussed structural reforms that could support growth 
in the medium-term. At present, the authorities plan to focus on structural reforms which 
would help them in (i) removing factors systemically undermining macroeconomic stability, 
(ii) allowing market forces to play a bigger role in resource allocation, and (iii) reducing 
barriers for private business. Such reforms will be important if the increase in sustainable 
growth projected over the medium term is to materialize. The authorities agreed that quasi-
fiscal activities and mandatory economic targets, including those on wages, have to be 
phased out to support macroeconomic stability, since they boosted domestic demand by 
distorting market signals and stretching capacity utilization. In this context, the authorities 
requested assistance from the IMF and the World Bank to prepare a strategy for developing a 
market-based incentive system. The authorities also recognize that improving economic 
efficiency will require market forces to play a more important role in resource allocation and 
the work towards further price liberalization and market–based lending by banks will be 
stepped up. Finally, the authorities will foster private sector development by further 
simplifying requirements for setting up new businesses, reducing conditions attached to new 
investment, and proceeding with small–scale privatization. 
V.   PROGRAM ISSUES AND CAPACITY TO REPAY  
23.      Understandings were reached on performance criteria and structural 
benchmarks for the remainder of the program period (Table 2 and 3 of the LOI). The 
authorities requested and the staff agreed to support a modification of the performance 
criteria on NIR and NDA for end-December 2009, given that the exchange rate movement 
allowed by the authorities will have effects mostly in 2010. As prior actions, the authorities 
have brought the basket value of the exchange rate to the level of 1,038 rubels and published 
their decision to recenter the exchange rate parity at its December 31, 2009 level to ensure 
continued exchange rate flexibility. In addition, to comply with a prior action the 2010 
budget has been submitted to Parliament by the President. Indicative targets for end-
  16  
 
March 2010 have been set in the context of the macroeconomic framework for the whole 
year. One additional structural benchmark (creating a further list of enterprises to be 
privatized) is added to further strengthen the reform agenda.  
24.      Belarus’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate. The level of Fund credit 
outstanding is expected to reach close to 51 percent of gross international reserves at its peak 
in 2009 and Fund repurchases and charges to amount to 31 percent of total debt service 
in 2013 (Table 9). While external debt is increasing it remains at a moderate level. Gross 
external debt is expected to peak at about 44 percent of GDP in 2010 and to fall thereafter as 
the current account deficit declines, suggesting that risks are manageable. Additional comfort 
stems from the fact that public debt is likely to remain below 30 percent of GDP even at its 
peak in 2010 (Appendix I). 
25.      The prospects for a successor arrangement will be an issue for discussion in the 
context of the final review of the SBA. At present, there is a financing gap for 2010 beyond 
the program period. With sound macroeconomic policies and ambitious structural reforms, 
this can be closed by resources from the Fund and other international donors. The financing 
gap for 2010 and beyond will be reassessed at the time of the fourth and final review of the 
SBA. The staff emphasized that continued good performance under the current program will 
also be important for Fund financial support under a potential follow-up program. 
VI.   STAFF APPRAISAL 
26.      Belarus is beginning to emerge from the crisis. Output remains subdued, and 
Belarus remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, given its high current account deficit 
and still low level of reserves. However, there are several encouraging signs. Export volumes 
have stabilized and are projected to recover. The exchange rate depreciation during the year 
has improved competitiveness, while confidence appears to be growing among households, 
as evidenced by the partial reversal of currency substitution. Fiscal policy has been consistent 
and strong, and the inconsistencies in the authorities’ credit policies are being addressed.  
27.      However, macroeconomic stability remains fragile and needs to be reinforced by 
strong and consistent policies. The January 2, 2009 devaluation sharpened households’ 
perceptions that radical changes in policy are likely to occur at end-year, and it is essential 
that the authorities present a clear and reassuring picture of their policy plans as the end of 
the year approaches. Pressures on the budget from local governments and line ministries will 
need to be resisted firmly. The edifice of credit under government programs channeled 
through commercial banks and financed by below–market rate refinancing from the NBRB 
needs to be dismantled, and the new agency designed to achieve this needs to be established 
quickly.  
28.      The authorities’ willingness to agree measures to compensate for a shortfall in 
external financing demonstrates their commitment to the program. Both the Ministry of 
Finance and the NBRB are meeting commitments made to the Fund before the second review 
  17  
 
of the SBA to adjust policies to close a $500 million financing gap. On the part of the 
Ministry of Finance, this involves maintaining painful expenditure cuts during the remainder 
of this year. The NBRB has agreed to important exchange rate measures which will help to 
reduce external pressures while increasing flexibility to handle unexpected shocks. 
29.      The authorities have stressed their determination to continue with sound 
macroeconomic policies in 2010. Faced with a choice between the “target scenario” which 
would not have been consistent with program commitments (or with economic reality) and a 
continuation into 2010 of strong but difficult policies agreed under the SBA, the authorities 
have chosen the latter. They have not abandoned the target scenario, but they intend to treat it 
as “motivational” and base policies on realistic assumptions and agreed program objectives.  
30.      However, the risk that authorities might lean towards the “target” scenario 
remains and the economy remains vulnerable to shocks. As the program draws to a close, 
and if external constraints ease, there are risks that the authorities will loosen policies too far 
or too quickly. Approaching elections will add to this risk. Moreover, the past year has 
shown the economy’s vulnerability to falls in demand for exports, disruption in the foreign 
exchange market, and shortfalls in official financing. The gradual ending of subsidies on oil 
and gas imports will add to the difficulties the authorities face.  
31.      Over the medium term both continued macroeconomic stabilization and 
structural reform will be needed. Belarus is set to emerge from the crisis in good shape, but 
the authorities will not only need to maintain tight macroeconomic policies for some time, 
but also make further progress in structural reform. Belarus is only beginning a process of 
structural transformation of the economy, and progress in liberalizing the economy and 
increasing productivity will be essential for rapid and sustainable growth.  
32.      The authorities are continuing to consider a follow-up program centered around 
structural reform, though they would like to defer a decision on this until next year. The 
authorities would like to explore the possibility of Fund support, though they also see a 
possibility that they could find sufficient external finance through foreign direct investment 
to avoid recourse to substantial new borrowing. With or without a new program, the 
authorities have emphasized their desire for a continued close relationship with the Fund. The 
staff believes that Belarus can benefit from the Fund’s continued advice and support on 
macroeconomic and structural issues, and from a closer relationship with the World Bank 
and other international financial institutions. 
33.      On the basis of the authorities’ good performance since the second review and 
the policies set out in the LOI, the staff recommends completion of the third review of 
the SBA, with a modification of the end-December NIR and NDA performance criteria.

APPENDIX II: BELARUS: LETTER OF INTENT 
Minsk, December 11, 2009 
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn 
Managing Director 
International Monetary Fund 
Washington, DC, 20431 U.S.A. 
 
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn: 
 
1.      This letter describes the economic policies and objectives of the authorities of the Republic 
of Belarus for the remainder of 2009 and for 2010. It supplements and amends the commitments 
made during the second review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the International 
Monetary Fund. Based on the policies we have pursued since the initiation of the SBA, we request 
the completion of the third review under the SBA. 
2.      We met all end-September program targets and end-September structural benchmarks 
outlined in our Letter of Intent (LOI) of September 30, 2009:  
 We tightened our credit policy by curtailing lending under government programs and 
suspending adoption of new programs through end-2009. Thanks to these measures, the end-
September performance criteria on net international reserves (NIR) and net domestic assets 
(NDA) were met.  
 Continued tight fiscal policy allowed us to meet the adjusted performance criterion for cash 
deficit at end-September 2009.  
 We implemented the structural benchmarks related to privatization and financial sector reform 
for end-September.  
3.      We were unable to implement some of the measures envisaged by our LOI as planned. To 
achieve budgetary savings we decided not to increase wages in the budgetary sector in 2009. To 
avoid erosion of households’ incomes we also decided to postpone an increase in tariffs on 
households’ utilities and transportation until 2010. We were unable to completely eliminate new 
lending to banks extended by the NBRB at below market rates due to our commitments to banks 
made prior to signing the previous LOI, but we have provided no other new lending, apart from that 
under housing construction. 
4.      We request a modification of the end-December performance criteria. A withdrawal of a 
commitment by Russia to provide the final $500 million tranche of a bilateral loan opened a 
financing gap. We have implemented fiscal and exchange rate measures to close the financing gap 
over the program period but we are unable to fully close it this year, since the full effect of these 
measures will be achieved only in 2010. We therefore request a modification of the end-December 
34 
 
NIR and NDA targets by $150 million and 265 billion rubels, respectively. The requested 
modification of performance criteria, prior actions and structural benchmarks are summarized in 
Tables 2 and 3. Table 2 also proposes indicative targets for end-March 2010. The fourth review will 
be held after February 15, 2010. 
5.      We believe that the policies set out in this letter are adequate to achieve the objectives of the 
program, but will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose. As is 
standard under all IMF arrangements, we will continue to consult with the IMF on the adoption of 
new measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies described in this letter. We will consult 
with Fund staff about the appropriate policy response if gross reserves fall below $5.6 billion 
before end-March 2010. We will also continue to provide the Fund with information as required to 
monitor progress on program implementation. We will consult with the Fund on our economic 
policies after the expiration of the arrangement, in line with the Fund’s policies on such 
consultations. Finally, we consent to the publication of this letter and the accompanying Executive 
Board documents on the IMF’s website.  
I.   PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK  
6.      Macroeconomic stability and sustainable economic growth remain our key objectives. Our 
macroeconomic policies would strengthen our external position and create opportunities for private 
sector development. Closing the financing gap during the remainder of the program required 
greater use of the exchange rate flexibility provided by the current regime, while maintaining tight 
fiscal and monetary policies. Our structural reforms focus on promoting macroeconomic stability 
and private initiative, while reducing government intervention in economic activity. Our social 
policies will ensure adequate social safety for the most needy.  
7.      The previously agreed macroeconomic framework remains largely valid for the balance of 
2009. We were able to avoid a deep recession and real GDP is expected to remain almost 
unchanged this year, compared with a year ago. However, the continued deterioration in the terms 
of trade would further widen the current account deficit bringing it close to 11 percent of GDP. The 
year-on-year inflation is expected to reach 10½ percent in 2009.  
8.      Our macroeconomic framework for 2010 would promote economic recovery, while 
bringing inflation to single digits and narrowing the external current account deficit. We will 
formulate our macroeconomic policies with the view of bringing the current account deficit to 
about 7 percent of GDP. This will be achieved by maintaining prudent fiscal and monetary policies 
and permitting exchange rate flexibility if needed, and will be facilitated by a gradual recovery in 
external demand and also some improvement in the terms of trade. Our objective is to increase 
international reserves to about $8½ billion (over 3 months of imports) during 2010. To further 
consolidate macroeconomic stability and reduce inflation we will keep the general government 
deficit to 1.7 percent of GDP. Credit to the economy is expected to rise by 15 percent, broadly in 
line with nominal GDP growth. The economy-wide wage policy would support our goal of 
improving international competitiveness. This disciplined approach is reflected in the budget and 
35 
 
monetary policy guidelines and Main Economic Indicators. It is consistent with 3¾ percent GDP 
growth, while the budget is based on a slightly more conservative GDP growth. 
9.      The nascent global economic recovery opens new opportunities for Belarus although risks 
remain high due to the uncertainty of the outlook. We are prepared to take timely measures to 
adjust our policies to seize every opportunity for a speedy economic recovery while maintaining 
macroeconomic stability. On the upside, a better than projected external economic environment, 
improved economic efficiency, bold structural reforms promoting private sector development and 
an increase in external financing, primarily through foreign direct investment, could generate 
economic growth in excess of the projected 3¾ percent. Moreover, if additional external financing 
becomes available the credit to the economy could be expanded in 2010. On the downside, a 
deterioration in the external economic environment or a shortfall in external financing would 
worsen prospects for economic growth. 
II.   MACROECONOMIC POLICIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF 2009  
10.      Our macroeconomic policies for the remainder of the year aim at achieving end-December 
performance criteria and closing the financing gap. To bolster our external competitiveness and to 
help us meet the NIR target we have brought the basket value to the level of 1,038 rubels (prior 
action). We have published in the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2010 the decision that the 
exchange rate parity will be recentered at its December 31, 2009 level to ensure continued 
exchange rate flexibility (prior action). We will issue a press statement following the approval of 
the Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2010 and publicly announce our decision on the central 
exchange rate parity. To support the exchange rate and to meet the NDA target we will reduce 
lending under government programs in line with the limit agreed during the second review of the 
SBA and will also contain credit to state enterprises with high levels of inventories. To meet our 
fiscal target despite budget support falling short of our projections, we have cut spending on goods 
and services and untargeted subsidies, while refraining from social spending cuts. We will offset 
local spending in excess of programmed levels by additional spending cuts by the central 
government.  
III.   MACROECONOMIC POLICIES IN 2010 
A.   Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies 
11.      Our monetary policy will continue to support the credibility of the exchange rate regime, 
while also keeping inflationary pressures under control. To this end, we will maintain tight credit 
policy by limiting lending under government programs. By end-2010 we will bring its share down 
to 46 percent of total claims on the economy and by end-2012 below 40 percent of total claims on 
the economy. To meet this objective we will limit net credit under government programs to 3¼ 
trillion rubels in 2010 and to 0.8 trillion rubels in the first quarter of 2010. This limit could be 
raised, in consultation with Fund staff, if additional foreign financing is received during 2010, or if 
additional lending is consistent with reducing its share in total claims on the economy to the agreed 
levels.  
36 
 
12.      Curtailing lending under government programs would free resources for market-based 
lending. To improve access to finance for the non-government sector we have recently reduced 
policy interest rates by 50 basis points. Any further interest rate reduction would depend on our 
ability to meet the reserve targets envisaged in the program, further dedollarization of the economy 
and progress on enforcing the limits on credit under government programs. 
13.      Our exchange rate regime has served us well and we will keep it in 2010. To maintain the 
flexibility of the exchange rate we will retain the ±10 percent trading band around the new 
recentered level. Barring unexpected external shocks we have no plans for additional exchange rate 
adjustment. However, we will be prepared to make more use of the flexibility within the band in 
order to support adjustment in the current account and to meet targeted levels of reserves.  
B.   Fiscal Policy 
14.      We remain committed to disciplined fiscal policy. Our fiscal policy will continue to support 
the exchange rate regime, while also facilitating economic recovery. To this end we decided to 
limit the general government deficit to 2.7 trillion rubels (1.7 percent of GDP) in 2010. The budget 
will be consistent with this commitment and will be submitted to Parliament by the President by 
December 11, 2009 (prior action) and signed into law by December 31, 2009.  
15.      We will continue our tight expenditure policy to meet our fiscal targets in 2010 and 
implement the following measures: 
 Wage and pension policies. We limited the increase in the wage bill to 11 percent in 2010 
which is consistent with the GDP growth of 3¾ percent. During the first quarter of 2010 the 
increase in wages in the budgetary sector in nominal terms will be no more than 5 percent. 
Any further wage increase in the budgetary sector after the first quarter will only be 
considered if macroeconomic conditions permit. We will maintain the practice of limiting 
wage growth in state-owned enterprises receiving government support. Our decisions on 
pension increases would be guided by the need to safeguard the viability of the Social 
Protection Fund and will maintain the normal relationship between pensions and wages. 
 Budget support to the economy. We will reduce net lending and spending on subsidies and 
transfers—the largest item in the budget—by cutting untargeted subsidies and transfers.  
 We will reduce fiscal subsidies on household utilities by increasing fees by US$7 
during the first half of 2010 and promoting cost cutting measures. We will adjust our 
policy on utility fees in line with changes in the price of imported natural gas.  
 We will also improve the cost recovery level of transportation fees by raising them 
by 18 percent during the first half of 2010. 
 We will streamline other subsidies to the economy to improve the allocation of 
resources.  
37 
 
 We will significantly reduce net lending by limiting new lending and by enforcing 
the repayment of maturing loans. 
16.      We introduced a new provision in our 2010 budget law limiting local governments’ deficits 
to 1 percent of their revenue (about 0.1 percent of GDP), if they are financed domestically. 
Moreover, our decisions on transfers from the central to local governments will ensure fiscal 
discipline of the local governments. If necessary, as in 2009, we will offset local governments’ 
overruns by reducing the central government non-priority spending on goods and services and 
subsidies.  
17.      Our fiscal policy aims at reducing the tax burden and the size of the government. In the 
context of the 2010 budget we will eliminate the turnover tax and also the local retail sales tax and 
other local taxes and fees. To offset the revenue loss arising from the elimination of some taxes, we 
will increase the rate on the value added tax by 2 percentage points bringing it to 20 percent. We 
will develop the tax reform strategy based on the recommendations of the FAD Technical 
Assistance mission on Tax Policy scheduled for the first quarter of 2010. To achieve expenditure 
savings we will request technical assistance on expenditure rationalization in the first quarter of 
2010. 
18.      We recently established an agency that would facilitate leasing of equipment by our 
exporters. To account for the potential fiscal costs of default by lessees, we have appropriated as a 
contingency line in the 2010 budget an amount equivalent to the expected repayment of the 
agency’s leases in that year, with the contingency line being reduced as payments are received. 
IV.   FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES 
19.      We adopted amendments to the regulation on loan classification and provisioning in 
September 2009, in line with the recommendations of the MCM TA mission. We have recently 
conducted an impact study of this new regulation on bank performance indicators. A schedule for 
implementing this regulation will then be designed on a bank-by-bank basis with the expectation 
that most banks would implement it by June 2010 and that it would be fully implemented by all 
banks by end-December 2010. 
20.      We have prepared a draft decree on establishing a special agency (SA) which will help 
clean banks’ balance sheets and assume the role currently played by banks in financing government 
programs, in line with the recommendations of the 2009 Financial Sector Stability Assessment 
(FSSA). We will submit this draft decree to the Head of State by end-December 2009. Loans 
disbursed under government programs and government funding held at banks will be transferred 
from commercial banks to this agency, which will replace commercial banks as the source of 
financing government programs. Banks, however, would be allowed to retain on their balance 
sheets a portion of the existing loans under government programs which they consider 
commercially viable. The agency will start functioning in 2010. The structure and governance of 
this agency will be discussed with the IMF staff. Initially, the functions of this agency will be 
38 
 
limited to managing the earlier disbursed loans, but during 2011 the agency will start distributing 
all new government program loans, with all new lending included in the budget above the line. To 
minimize problem loans associated with lending under government programs, we will strengthen 
the targeting and monitoring of such lending. 
21.      Banks remain adequately capitalized and we have no plans for bank recapitalization in 2009 
and 2010. Moreover, we expect that the capitalization of banks would automatically improve 
following the transfer of assets and liabilities associated with lending under government programs 
to the SA. However, we will be prepared to provide some limited recapitalization to those banks 
whose capital adequacy indicators would fall below the prudential minimum or would be expected 
to fall below the minimum based on plausible stress tests even after the transfer of assets and 
liabilities to the SA. Should private banks become undercapitalized, we will use our existing 
framework, as appropriate, to rapidly resolve the issues. 
22.      We have been working on strengthening the financial system and the independence of the 
NBRB. Specifically we are focusing on the following areas: 
 Strengthening banks’ liquidity. We will strictly enforce prudential liquidity ratios for all 
banks. We will ensure that state banks remain liquid by further curtailing their ability to 
extend new loans if their liquidity ratios fall below the prudential norms. Moreover, the 
limit on credit under government programs should prevent a deterioration of liquidity ratios 
at state-owned banks, while a transfer of assets and liabilities related to lending under 
government programs to the SA would improve banks’ liquidity.  
 Phasing out non-market liquidity support. We recognize that the NBRB liquidity support on 
non-market terms is distortionary and has to be phased out. To this end in 2009 we will not 
extend new loans to banks at interest rates below rates on standard refinancing facilities 
(e.g. Lombard auctions) except credits for housing construction. We will also refrain from 
any new liquidity support on non-market terms in 2010 and will refinance banks in line with 
the repayment schedule of such loans based on earlier commitments until the SA is 
established and begins lending under the government programs. The outstanding stock of 
non-market-based lending will not exceed 8.0 trillion rubels.  
 Formalizing the framework for emergency liquidity assistance to banks. In line with the 
recommendations of the recent MCM technical assistance mission, the NBRB will adopt a 
formal framework and guidelines for the provision of emergency liquidity assistance (ELA) 
to banks. The framework should specify when and in what situations ELA can be granted, 
who makes the decisions and determines the terms, coordination and information sharing 
amongst the relevant bodies, and any special conditions attached. Guidelines should refer to 
the term and interest rates which apply, eligible collateral, additional conditions imposed 
upon the borrowing bank, and communication policy.  
39 
 
 Improving operational and financial independence of the NBRB. Building on the 
recommendations of the FSSA and the Safeguards Assessments, we have prepared draft 
amendments and supplements to the Statute of the NBRB approved by Decree of the 
President of the Republic of Belarus #320 dated June 13, 2001 with further amendments 
being introduced into the Banking Code to ensure operational and financial independence of 
the NBRB (structural benchmark). We requested an IMF technical assistance mission to 
assist us with finalizing these documents and we will submit the revised drafts of this 
legislation to the President by end-February 2010. 
 Disengaging the NBRB from non-core business. In line with earlier program commitments, 
net increase in NBRB’s direct or equity financing of non-financial organizations will remain 
within the ceiling of 350 billion rubels in 2009 and any new lending or equity investment in 
non-financial organizations will be discontinued thereafter. We have been working on 
developing an action plan for divesting all NBRB non-financial subsidiaries and associated 
companies and will finalize it by end-December.  
 Curbing directed lending financed with government deposits. In line with our legislation 
prohibiting the central and local governments from making any additional transfers to their 
deposit accounts with commercial banks, we will continue transferring the existing stock of 
these deposits back to NBRB accounts in line with the schedule for repayment of 
corresponding loans. An exception will be made for certain central and local government 
demand deposits held for operational purposes. We will continue to refrain from approving 
any new directed lending programs financed with budget deposits (continuous structural 
benchmark).  
 Bank privatization. We are close to completing a sale of Belpromstroibank, and we have 
been looking for strategic investors to buy the majority shareholding in OJSC Belinvestbank 
and minority holdings in JSSB Belarusbank and OJSC Belagroprombank. We will engage 
qualified, experienced and reputable consultants, on a competitive basis, to assist us in 
preparing state-owned banks for partial or full privatization after strategic investors have 
been identified.  
23.      In line with the recommendations of the Safeguards Assessment the end-September 
quantitative PCs relating to NIR and NDA have been audited by international accountants and we 
will continue this practice until the end of the program. 
V.   STRUCTURAL REFORMS 
24.      Our structural reform agenda aims at supporting macroeconomic stability allowing market 
forces to play a greater role in resource allocation and foster private sector development. To this 
end we developed a legal framework for privatization to become competitive, transparent and 
professionally executed. A draft Privatization Law and the draft decree on establishing a 
privatization agency incorporating comments from the World Bank were submitted to Parliament 
40 
 
and the President, respectively, on September 30, 2009. We have selected five enterprises as 
candidates for privatization and their controlling equity stakes will be offered for sale through an 
open, international, transparent, and competitive tender by end-February, 2010. In November we 
submitted the list of these enterprises to the Head of State for approval. Furthermore, by end-
February 2010 we will compile a list of enterprises from the list of companies included in the 
privatization plan for 2008-10 (structural benchmark) and task the privatization agency with 
preparing these enterprises for privatization through an open, international, transparent and 
competitive bidding process.  
25.      We attach great importance to promoting market-based economic growth. We have 
eliminated all instructions that are not consistent with our commitment not to impose a general 
ceiling on monthly price increases. We recently implemented several measures bringing us closer 
to market based pricing. These included (i) removing the restrictions on retail trade margins, except 
for a limited list of goods and (ii) eliminating requirements for price registration. We have been 
working towards eliminating quantitative economic targets. The Council of Ministers will issue by 
end-December 2009, a recommendation to the line ministries and other government agencies in 
charge of economic activity, including local governments, not to set any quantitative targets for 
2010, such as output and employment targets, for the companies that do not benefit from 
government’s financial support and in which the government has a minority share (structural 
benchmark). We will refrain from the application of mandatory wage policy to companies in 
which the government does not have majority control. The government’s right in such companies 
will not extend beyond the rights of all minority shareholders. The government together with the 
IMF and the World Bank will prepare proposals to be used in order to migrate from mandatory 
quantitative targets to a market-based incentive system.

BELARUS—TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU) 
December 11, 2009 
 
1.      This memorandum sets out the understandings between Belarus’s authorities and the 
IMF staff regarding the definitions of performance criteria. The performance criteria are 
reported in Table 2 of the Letter of Intent (LOI) dated December 11, 2009. 
 
2.      The definitions of the performance criteria and the adjustment mechanisms are 
described in Section I below. Reporting requirements are specified in Section II. 
 
3.      The exchange rates and the price of gold to be used for the purpose of monitoring the 
program are in Table 1 of this attachment, and benchmarks for calculating the adjustors in 
Table 2. 
 
I.   QUANTITATIVE TARGETS 
A.   Floor on Net International Reserves of the National Bank of the Republic of 
Belarus (NBRB) 
Definition 
4.      Net international reserves (NIR) of the NBRB are defined as the difference between 
gross international reserve assets and reserve liabilities, evaluated in U.S. dollars at the 
program exchange rates (Table 1). Gross international reserve assets are defined as readily 
available claims on nonresidents, denominated in foreign convertible currencies. They 
include the NBRB’s holdings of monetary gold, SDRs, foreign currency cash, foreign 
currency securities, deposits abroad, and the country’s reserve position at the Fund. Excluded 
from gross international reserve assets are:  
 any assets denominated in foreign currencies held at, or which are claims on, 
domestic institutions (i.e., institutions headquartered domestically, but located either 
domestically or abroad, or institutions headquartered abroad, but located 
domestically);  
 any precious metals or metal deposits, other than monetary gold, held by the NBRB; 
 any reserve assets that are: (i) encumbered; or (ii) pledged as collateral (in so far as 
not already included in foreign liabilities); or (iii) frozen; and 
 any reserve assets that are not readily available for intervention in the foreign 
exchange market, inter alia, because of lack of quality or lack of liquidity that limits 
marketability at the book price. 
 
5.      For the purpose of this program, reserve liabilities comprise: 
  45  
 
 all short-term liabilities of the NBRB vis-à-vis nonresidents with an original maturity 
of one year or less; 
 all foreign exchange liabilities to resident entities (e.g. claims in foreign exchange of 
domestic banks on the NBRB) excluding (i) foreign exchange liabilities to the general 
government, to the Agency for Deposit Guarantee, and (ii) the NBRB’s foreign 
exchange transitory accounts; 
 the stock of IMF credit outstanding; and 
 the nominal value of all derivative positions8 of the NBRB and government, implying 
the sale of foreign currency or other reserve assets against domestic currency. 
6.      For program monitoring purposes, the stock of foreign assets and foreign liabilities of 
the NBRB shall be valued at program exchange rates, as described in paragraph 3 above. 
On this basis, and consistent with the definition above, the stock of NIR amounted to 
$2,541 million on November 30, 2008. In addition, a purchase from the IMF will be reflected 
in the stock of IMF credit outstanding on the same day when the purchase is reflected in the 
gross international reserves. 
Adjustment mechanism 
7.      The floor on the NIR of the NBRB is subject to an automatic adjustor, based on 
deviations of external balance of payments support (defined as disbursements from bilateral 
and multilateral creditors to the NBRB), or external Republican government9 budget support 
and privatization proceeds from program projections (Table 2 of the LOI).  
A. If the proceeds from external balance of payments support to the NBRB (in U.S. dollars 
evaluated at program exchange rates): 
a) cumulatively exceeds program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will be 
adjusted upward by 100 percent of the excess in external balance of payments support; 
and 
b) in any quarter falls short of program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will 
be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the shortfall in that quarter, 50 percent of the 
shortfall in the previous quarter. Disbursements in excess of its programmed level in any 
quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall for the previous quarter in calculating 
the adjusted target.  
                                                 
8 This refers to the notional value of the commitments, not the market value. 
9 As defined in paragraph 12 below. 
  46  
 
B. If the proceeds from external Republican government budget support and external 
privatization proceeds (valued in U.S. dollars at program exchange rates): 
a) cumulatively exceed program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will be 
adjusted upwards by 50 percent of the excess in external budget support and privatization 
proceeds; and  
b) in any quarter falls short of program projections, the floor on the NIR of the NBRB will 
be adjusted downward by 100 percent of the shortfall in that quarter, and 50 percent of 
the shortfall in the previous quarter. Disbursements in excess of its programmed level in 
any quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall for the previous quarter in 
calculating the adjusted target. 
 
8.      If Belarus participates in any SDR allocation(s) between March 31, 2009 and any 
subsequent test dates, the NIR target will be adjusted upwards by 100 percent of the 
equivalent of the amount of the cumulative additional SDR allocation(s) up to the test date, 
measured at program exchange rates. 
B.   Ceiling on Net Domestic Assets of the NBRB 
Definition  
9.      Net domestic assets (NDA) of the NBRB is defined as the difference between the 
NBRB’s monetary base, as defined by the NBRB’s methodology as of March 31, 2009, and 
NIR. The NIR of the NBRB is defined as in paragraph 4 above. 
10.      Performance against the NDA target will be measured at program exchange rates. On 
this basis, and consistent with the definition above, the NBRB’s NDA amounted to RBL 
2,112 billion on November 30, 2008.  
Adjustment mechanism 
11.      The ceiling on the NDA of the NBRB is subject to an automatic adjustor, based on 
adjustment of the NIR of the NBRB, as stipulated in paragraphs 7 and 8 above. 
 
 
  47  
 
C.   Ceiling on the Cash Deficit of the General Government 
 
Definitions 
 
12.      The general government includes the Republican government and local governments. 
The Republican government is defined as the central government ministries, the funds 
included in the Republican budget, including the National Development Fund and the Social 
Protection Fund. In case the government establishes new extrabudgetary funds, they will be 
integrated into the Republican government. 
 
13.      The cash deficit of the general government will be measured from the financing side 
as the sum of (i) net domestic financing from banks and nonbanks, (ii) net external financing, 
and (iii) privatization receipts. 
 
(i) Net domestic financing consists of bank and nonbank financing to the general 
government and will be defined as follows: 
 
i. The change in the claims on the general government of commercial banks minus the 
change in deposits held by the general government in commercial banks, net of 
revaluation effect for foreign currency deposits. 
 
ii. The change in the claims on the general government of the NBRB minus the change 
in deposits of the general government held at the NBRB in RBLs and foreign 
currency, net of revaluation effect for foreign currency deposits. 
 
iii. Net claims on the general government of the commercial banks and the NBRB will be 
monitored based on the monetary survey prepared by the NBRB. 
 
iv. Also included are any other liability instruments issued by the general government, 
for example, promissory notes, any other increase in liability of the general 
government to domestic nonbank institutions. 
 
v. Net sales of Treasury bills, bonds, or other government securities to nonbank 
institutions and households (including nonresidents and nonresident financial 
institutions), plus any other increase in liability of the general government to 
domestic nonbank institutions. 
 
(ii) Net external financing is defined as: 
 
i. Total of loans disbursed to the general government for general budget support and 
project financing, the change in the stock of outstanding international bonds, net 
change in external arrears, change in the accounts of the Republican government 
  48  
 
abroad, minus amortization. Amortization includes all external debt-related payments 
of principal by the general government. 
 
ii. Amortization to external creditors via third parties is accounted for at the time and in 
the amount of payment by the budget to the third party, rather than at the time of 
recognition of amortization by the external creditor. 
 
(iii) Privatization receipts: 
 
i. The privatization receipts of the general government consist of all transfers of monies 
received by the Ministry of Finance in connection with the sale of general 
government assets, including privatization proceeds, which were transferred to the 
National Development Fund. 
 
ii. This includes receipts from the sales of shares, the sale of assets and the sale of 
licenses with duration of 10 years and longer. 
 
14.      For the purposes of measuring the deficit of the general government, all flows to/from 
the budget in foreign currency will be converted into RBLs at the official exchange rate 
prevailing at close of business on the date of the transaction. On this basis, and consistent 
with the definition above, the cash deficit of the general government in the first half of 2009 
amounted to 961 billion rubels. 
 
Adjustment mechanism 
 
15.      The ceilings on the cash deficit of the general government for end-September and 
end-December are subject to automatic adjustors, based on deviations of external budget and  
project support from program projections (Table 2 of the LOI). If the total proceeds from 
external budget and project support (excluding from international financial institutions and 
projects initiated before the original program) to the general government budget (in RBLs 
converted at the official exchange rate on the days of its receipt): 
 
 Cumulatively exceed program projections, the ceiling on the cash deficit of the 
general government will be adjusted upwards by 50 percent of the excess in budget 
and project support to the government. 
 Cumulatively falls short of program projections, the ceiling on the cash deficit of the 
general government will be adjusted downward by 50 percent of the cumulative 
shortfall in the previous quarter, if any. Disbursements in excess of its programmed 
level in any quarter, will be fully applied to reduce the shortfall, if any, for the 
previous quarter in calculating the adjusted target. 
  49  
 
 For project support from international financial institutions, if disbursements in 
foreign currency exceed (fall short of) program projections, the ceiling on the cash 
deficit of the general government will be adjusted upwards (down) by 100 percent of 
the excess (shortfall) in project support.  
 For project support for projects initiated before the original program was approved, 
the ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government will be adjusted upwards by 
100 percent of the excess in project support. The adjustor for such projects is capped 
at $353 million. 
16.      The ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government is also subject to an 
automatic adjustor for recapitalization of banks. Specifically, the ceiling on the deficit will be 
adjusted upward for the amount of funds provided by the Republican budget to banks to 
bring their regulatory capital to minimum statutory levels. 
17.      Total annual adjustor for higher-than-programmed international financial assistance, 
including project support for projects initiated before the original program was approved, is 
capped at 1.8 percent of GDP. 
18.      The ceiling on the cash deficit of the general government is also subject to an 
automatic adjustor for local governments’ deficit financed with surpluses accumulated 
in 2008. Total annual adjustor for the deficits of local governments is capped at RBL 
1.4 trillion.  
D.   Continuous Performance Criteria on Nonaccumulation of External Arrears 
19.      During the period of arrangement, the Republican government and the NBRB will not 
accumulate any new external payments arrears on debt service obligations to official 
creditors. Official external payment arrears are defined as unpaid debt service by the 
Republican government and the NBRB beyond 30 days after the due date. The performance 
criterion on nonaccumulation of external arrears is continuous.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Belarus 
December 18, 2009 
 
1.      This statement reports on key developments since the staff report was finalized. The 
new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. 
2.      The authorities continued to take measures in line with their Letter of Intent: 
 The draft 2010 budget consistent with program commitments, which was submitted to 
Parliament by the President on December 7, passed the second reading in the lower 
house, and is being considered by the upper house. 
 Belarus and the Russian Sberbank signed an agreement on December 11 to sell 93.27 
percent of the shares of Belpromstroibank to Sberbank for $280.8 million.  
3.      The macroeconomic framework underpinning the program is reflected in the key 
documents guiding macroeconomic policies—the draft 2010 budget and monetary policy 
guidelines, but the 2010 Main Economic Indicators issued by the President on December 7 
contains over-ambitious growth targets that are not consistent with the program projections.  
4.      It now appears certain that there will be a delay in the disbursement of some $290 
million in macrofinancial assistance (MFA) from the EU, which was originally expected to 
be disbursed in the fourth quarter of 2009. There is also some risk that disbursement could 
slip until after the program period, in which case, according to the European Commission, it 
would become dependent on a new Fund arrangement being in place or there being a 
reasonable assurance that such an arrangement will be in place. The reason for the delay is a 
legal ruling in the EU that all requests for macrofinancial assistance must be considered by 
the new European Commission instead of the outgoing Commission, which will delay the 
Commission’s consideration of the MFA until at least January, following which the loan 
must be discussed and approved by the European Parliament. In light of this delay, the 
authorities have stated that they are prepared to implement measures that would reduce 
external financing needs by about $300 million over the full year of 2010. The measures 
could include reducing credit growth to the economy and some reduction in budgetary 
spending to offset lower revenue resulting from a tighter credit policy. The contingency 
measures, if needed, will be discussed and agreed with the staff during the fourth review. 
Implementation of such measures would ensure that program objectives continue to be met, 
although the quantitative targets for end-March 2010 may need to be modified since it would 
take some time for these measures to take effect. The authorities are also continuing to search 
for alternative sources of finance to offset any shortfall in EU financing and reduce the need 
for contingency measures 
5.      Recent economic data are consistent with the analysis in the staff report.  GDP 
declined by 0.4 percent year-on-year in the first eleven months. Twelve-month CPI inflation 
  2  
 
fell further to 10.0 percent in November. The trade deficit in the first ten months reached 
$5.7 billion, higher than expected. However, NIR has increased recently and is now close to 
the adjusted end-December target level. Based on available data, the authorities are expected 
to be able to meet the revised end-December performance criteria. The outlook for 2010 is 
broadly unchanged from the projection in the staff report.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Press Release No. 09/473 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  
December 18, 2009  
 
 
IMF Completes Third Review Under Stand-By Arrangement with Belarus, 
Approves US$688 Million Disbursement 
 
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the third 
review of Belarus’s performance under an economic program supported under a Stand-By 
Arrangement (SBA). The 15-month, SDR 1.62 billion (about US$2.46 billion) SBA was 
approved on January 12, 2009 (see Press Release No. 09/05) and on June 29, 2009 the size of 
financial package provided under the SBA was increased to an amount equivalent to SDR 
2.27 billion (about US$3.63 billion) (see Press Release No. 09/241). 
 
The completion  of the third review enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 437.93 
million (about US$688 million), bringing total disbursements under the program so far to an 
amount equivalent to about SDR 1.83 billion (about US$2.88 billion). 
 
The Executive Board approved modification of the performance criteria on international 
reserves and net domestic assets for end-December 2009 and structural benchmarks for the 
remainder of the program. The Staff Report and the Letter of Intent for the third review will 
be released after the authorities’ review, while the papers for the second review, which was 
completed on October 21, will be released shortly. 
 
Following the Executive Board's discussion on Belarus, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy 
Managing Director and Acting Chair, stated: 
 
“Performance under Belarus’s Stand-By Arrangement has been strong, and the economy is 
beginning to emerge from the crisis. Export volumes have stabilized, the exchange rate 
depreciation has improved competitiveness, and confidence appears to be growing among 
households. At the same time, Belarus remains vulnerable to external shocks, requiring 
continued prudent macroeconomic policies as well as flexibility in the face of uncertainties. 
In this regard, the authorities’ commitment to take difficult measures to compensate for 
shortfalls and delays in external financing is commendable. 
 
International Monetary Fund

“It is important to solidify gains in external and domestic stability in the course of 2010. 
Aiming for an unrealistically high growth rate would increase pressure on the current account 
and increase Belarus’s vulnerability to external shocks. It is therefore important that the 
authorities base policies on realistic assumptions and agreed program objectives. 
 
“A key element of the 2010 macroeconomic framework is a prudent credit policy. The 
authorities’ decision to limit lending under government programs is welcome. Establishing a 
special agency that would clean up banks’ balance sheets and eventually replace banks in 
financing government programs will be an important step forward. The establishment of this 
agency will also allow the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus to terminate bank 
refinancing on non-market terms. Success in containing credit under government programs 
should make it possible to gradually ease interest rates in the credit market. 
 
“The authorities’ continuing commitment to pursue a prudent budget policy is an important 
building block in achieving program objectives. The 2010 budget will add little to public 
debt and will free up resources for the private sector. The authorities’ plans to improve 
targeted social assistance, mitigating the effects of the crisis on the poor, are welcome. 
 
“Advances in structural reform will be key to achieving high and sustainable growth. The 
authorities have already made progress in developing legal and institutional frameworks for 
privatization and in easing administrative controls. Further decisive progress in liberalizing 
the economy and increasing productivity will remain a priority to be sustained over the 
medium term.  
 
“Continuation of the close collaboration with the Fund is welcome. The Fund stands ready 
for continued advice and support on macroeconomic and structural issues. Belarus would 
also benefit from a closer relationship with the World Bank and other international financial 
institutions,” Mr. Kato said.  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus 
and Mr. Vadim Misyukovets, Advisor to Executive Director 
December 18, 2009 
 
 
 
The Belarusian authorities appreciated the constructive dialogue with the Fund staff during 
the Third Review under the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA). They broadly agree with the 
staff’s assessment of the current macroeconomic situation and recommendations on 
economic and financial policies for the remainder of 2009 and for 2010.  
 
Since the completion of the Second Review, all end-September program targets have been 
met and good progress was made in meeting structural benchmarks under the program. All 
the prior actions for this Review have been completed. The requested modification of the 
end-December performance criteria is the consequence of the withdrawal of a bilateral loan 
commitment which surprised both the authorities and the Fund staff. Discussions about 
borrowing from the Russian Federation are continuing.  
 
Also, we have recently learned that due to procedural changes, the disbursement of the 
Macro Financial Assistance (MFA) by the European Union might be delayed beyond the 
period covered by the Stand-By Arrangement. This could open a financing gap of some 
US$ 300 million. Given uncertainty with regard to the disbursement of the MFA, the 
authorities are prepared, if necessary, to implement measures that would allow them to 
reduce their financing needs during 2010 to offset any shortfall in EU financing. The 
measures could include reducing credit growth to the economy and some reduction in 
budgetary spending to offset lower revenue resulting from a tighter credit policy. 
Contingency measures will be discussed and agreed upon with the Fund staff during the 
Fourth Review under the Stand-By Arrangement if it appears that the MFA disbursement is 
likely to be delayed beyond the program period. The authorities continue to search for 
alternative sources of financing to offset any shortfall in EU financing and reduce the need 
for contingency measures. 
 
The authorities have a good track record of meeting their commitments, and have always 
taken strong contingency measures to close the financing gap as a result of the external 
financing shortfall and to increase competitiveness. They made full use of exchange rate 
flexibility to facilitate external adjustment and meet the net international reserves (NIR) 
target. As a result of these measures, the rubel was allowed to depreciate to the bottom of the 
exchange rate band. Consequently, in addition to the 20 percent step devaluation in 
January 2009, the rubel has depreciated by 7.9 percent against the dollar, 13.7 percent against  
 2 
 
the euro and 3.1 percent against the Russian ruble (by 8.15 percent against the basket of 
currencies) over the program period. Furthermore, in agreement with the Fund staff, the 
authorities approved and made public a recentering of the exchange rate parity of the 
±10 percent band downwards to ensure that possible future external shocks are adequately 
met. Monetary and fiscal policies have been tightened, adhering to the commitments made 
during the Second Review. 
 
During the period January - November 2009, GDP declined by 0.4 percent as compared to 
the same period in 2008. Belarus’ external position remains vulnerable but positive trends are 
beginning to emerge. Although in January - September, the current account deficit had 
widened to US$ 4.4 billion, since then the current account deterioration has slowed down 
noticeably. In the third quarter, the current account deficit was US$ 706.5 million, falling by 
2.5 times relative to US$ 1.8 billion in the second quarter. In October, inflation declined to 
11 percent and was just above 10 percent in November. 
 
Belarus’ international reserves have been strengthening. During January - November 2009, 
reserves grew by 50 percent and on December 1, they were at US$ 4.6 billion. In November, 
reserves increased by 3.7 percent or US$ 163 million. The authorities expect the reserves to 
rise further and reach the projected target by the end of 2009. For 2010, international reserves 
are projected to grow between US$ 0.5 billion to US$ 1.8 billion, depending on the external 
environment. 
 
The credibility of the monetary authorities and confidence in the currency and the banking 
system have been preserved. Household deposits in the domestic currency increased by 
4.2 percent in November, while foreign exchange deposits grew by only 1.1 percent. As a 
result, for the first time since January 2009, on December 1, the share of rubel deposits in the 
banking system exceeded that of foreign exchange deposits by rubels 105 billion. With 
amendments to the loan classification and provisioning regulation in line with Fund 
recommendations, the share of non-performing loans was at a relatively safe level of 
5.5 percent of the assets subject to credit risk. As of November 1, the capital adequacy ratio 
has improved slightly to 19.7 percent, as compared to 19 percent at end-September 2009. 
 
Conforming to the program, the authorities have limited credit under the government 
programs and to the economy more generally. They have also refrained from introducing 
new government lending programs. The authorities are finalizing the drafting of a decree on 
the establishment of a special agency that will start functioning in 2010 and take over loans 
under government programs from commercial banks. 
 
The authorities remain committed to tight fiscal policy, which is the core of the 
macroeconomic adjustment program. They have maintained this policy by containing 
government expenditure. The performance criterion for the cash deficit was met at 
end-September this year. Measures taken to limit the expenditures as well as deferred 
spending of targeted budgetary funds and separate budget items enabled the authorities to 
execute the central government budget in January - October 2009 with a surplus of 
 3 
 
rubels 288 billion, or about US$100 million. By the end of the year, government spending 
will be cut further as part of the contingency adjustment package to address the external 
financing gap.  
 
Pensions, which were under a freeze since August 2008, were increased by 9.5 percent in 
November. In order to maintain a balanced budget in 2009, the 5 percent increase in budget 
sector wages was, once again, postponed to January 1, 2010. In 2010, tariffs on household 
utilities will be increased by 13 percent. Passenger transportation tariffs will be raised by 
18 percent in the first half of 2010.  
 
The 2010 budget, containing a modest deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP and the Special Part of 
the Tax Code was approved by the House of Representatives in the second reading on 
December 11 and submitted to the upper Chamber of the Parliament. The new fiscal 
legislation aims at streamlining Belarus’ tax system to bring it closer to the average European 
taxation principles. In particular, four taxes, including the turnover tax on the agriculture 
support fund, will be abolished. To compensate for the loss of revenue, the VAT rate will be 
increased from 18 to 20 percent to provide for additional receipts of rubels 1.7 trillion, 
effective January 1, 2010. On the expenditure side, the 2010 budget has a strong social 
protection focus and aims at maintaining the quality of social services and strengthening 
social guarantees. The authorities are aware that budget execution faces risks. Therefore they 
have taken a cautious approach to the expenditure commitments so that adjustments can be 
made proactively to the changing economic environment.   
 
The authorities intend to continue working with bilateral and multilateral creditors to ensure 
timely disbursements of all committed funds, while exploring prospects for new external 
financing. In particular, the Ministry of Finance has taken concrete steps to tap international 
financial markets. The authorities believe that it will be feasible to issue the first sovereign 
bond in 2010, provided that market conditions at least do not deteriorate. 
 
The sale of BPS Bank – the fourth largest bank in Belarus – to Russia’s Sberbank is in its 
final stage to bring to the country about US$ 280 million of privatization proceeds.  
 
The authorities remain strongly committed to economic liberalization, structural reforms and 
promoting private initiative. Practical steps have been continuously taken to improve 
Belarus’ business environment and to ameliorate conditions for private sector development. 
Strong measures were taken as prior actions under the World Bank Development Policy 
Loan to soften control and supervision, reduce licensing, streamline administrative 
procedures, reduce tax distortions and the tax burden, soften price controls, and amend the 
privatization legislation. The World Bank Executive Board welcomed these measures and 
endorsed the US$ 200 million loan on December 1, 2009.  
 
The authorities reiterate their commitment to further reforms in 2010 and beyond in 
cooperation with the World Bank Group, IMF and other international financial institutions. 
The envisaged reforms, as announced recently, would include a large-scale opening of 
 4 
 
Belarus’ economy for foreign investors and encouraging competitiveness in all sectors. To 
this end, an action plan has been designed to improve the business climate further in order to 
reach the ambitious objective of entering the group of top 30 economies with the most 
business friendly environment in the Doing Business 2011 Report. In the longer term, the 
authorities plan to improve significantly Belarus’ ranking by other criteria such as 
competitiveness, efficiency of government, innovation, and economic freedom. 
 
On the basis of the information provided above and in the Staff Report, we request the 
Board’s approval of the Third Review of the SBA and of the modification of the end-
December NIR and NDA targets.
