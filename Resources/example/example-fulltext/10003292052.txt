ABSTRACT 
 
Youth Unemployment and Crime in France*
 
In this paper we examine the influence of unemployment on property crimes and on violent 
crimes in France for the period 1990 to 2000. This analysis is the first extensive study for this 
country. We construct a regional-level data set (for the 95 départements of metropolitan 
France) with measures of crimes as reported to the Ministry of Interior. To assess social 
conditions prevailing in the département in that year, we construct measures of the 
unemployment rate as well as other social, economic and demographic variables using 
multiple waves of the French Labor Survey. We estimate a classic Becker type model in 
which unemployment is a measure of how potential criminals fare in the legitimate job 
market. First, our estimates show that in the cross-section dimension, crime and 
unemployment are positively associated. Second, we find that increases in youth 
unemployment induce increases in crime. Using the predicted industrial structure to 
instrument unemployment, we show that this effect is causal for burglaries, thefts, and drug 
offences. To combat crime, it appears thus that all strategies designed to combat youth 
unemployment should be examined.

1. Introduction 
 
In this paper we examine the influence of unemployment on property crimes as well as on 
violent crimes in France for the recent period (1990 to 2000). During this period, the 
unemployment rate first increased, then decreased. More precisely, between 1990 and 1997, 
labor market opportunities fell dramatically (the unemployment rate rose from 8.9 to 12.5 
percent). After 1997 the French economy started to recover. The crime pattern for the same 
period is completely different from that observed for unemployment. Indeed, during the 
1990s, property crime rates first increased from 1990 to 1993, and then declined slowly. 
During the same period, violent crime rates kept increasing. These divergent trends led former 
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin to confess – while running for the presidency, in March 2002 – 
« J'ai péché un peu par naïveté. Je me suis dit (...) : si l'on fait reculer le chômage, on va faire 
reculer l'insécurité » (I was naive. I said to myself (…) : if we make unemployment decrease, 
we will make insecurity decrease). This paper is the first extensive study of this controversial 
issue in France. Using a variety of data sets, we examine the effects of changes in 
unemployment on crime. In particular, we compare the effects of changes in unemployment 
rates of older workers with those of younger workers. In addition, we examine the impact of 
unemployment benefits on crime.  
 
Most empirical research on the economics of crime aims at testing the Becker hypothesis that 
the propensity to commit crime depends on the comparison of the expected costs and benefits 
of legal and illegal activities (Becker, 1968, Ehrlich, 1996). Some researchers have focused 
on the costs side and evaluated the deterrent effects of apprehension and penalization 
(Ehrlich, 1973; Levitt, 1997; Imai and Krishna, 2004). Others have examined the relation 
between labor market and crime, concentrating on measures of the potential benefits of legal 
opportunities (see the literature reviews by Freeman, 1983, 1984, 1996, 1999). Among them, 
some have assessed the effect of wages on crime rates. Using aggregate data, Gould, 
Weinberg and Mustard (2002) for the US, and Machin and Meghir (2004) for the UK show 
that decreases in unskilled workers wages lead to increases in crime. Grogger (1998) 
estimates a structural model using individual-level data, and suggests that falling wages may 
be an important determinant of rising youth crime. Some have tried to relate income 
inequality and crime (Kelly, 2000; Fajnzylber, Lederman and Loayza, 2002); these authors 
tend to show that more inequality is associated to higher crime rates.  
 3
 On the contrary, the literature examining the links between crime and unemployment fails to 
reach any consensus. Most studies assume that unemployment is a measure of how potential 
criminals fare in the legitimate job market. From the theoretical point of view this hypothesis 
seems, at first glance, reasonable. Indeed, according to Becker’s economic theory of crime, 
unemployed people are deprived of legal income resources (except for unemployment 
benefits), and, thus, are more likely to derive some income from illegal activities. But 
empirical findings based on aggregate data suggest that this relationship is not particularly 
strong. According to Chiricos’ review (1987), most studies of this type find a positive 
relationship between unemployment and crime, but this effect is not always significant, and 
some even find a negative association. For example, using panel data for Germany, Entorf 
and Spengler (2000) confirm the ambiguous result for total unemployment, even if they 
suggest that youth unemployment is associated with a higher probability of committing 
crimes. Studies based on individual-level data (such as Witte and Tauchen, 1994, who use 
data from a cohort sample of young men) provide more convincing evidence that crime is 
linked to unemployment. Thornberry and Christenson (1984) investigate the causal structure 
between unemployment and crime. According to their results, unemployment has significant 
instantaneous effects on crime and crime has significant but lagged effects on unemployment. 
Cantor and Land (1985) try to identify two distinct (and potentially counterbalancing) 
mechanisms, criminal opportunity and criminal motivation, through which unemployment 
may affect crime rates in the aggregate. 
 
In this article, we estimate a classic Becker-type model and suggest some arguments 
explaining why most studies were not able to find a strong relation between crime and 
unemployment. To accomplish this task, we add several elements to the existing literature.  
 
First, this paper is the first econometric analysis for France of this precise question (see 
however Roché, 2001, for an extensive descriptive study of young criminals). We use both 
aggregate and individual-level data sets. We construct a unique Département-level data set 
(there are 95 départements in France, approximately an American county) measuring crimes 
as reported to the Interior Ministry for the years 1990-2000. 17 crime categories are available: 
this allows us to separate property crimes (which are more likely to fit the Becker’s model of 
the rational offender) and violent crimes, and to study precisely the temporal and geographic 
correlations between these categories.  
 4
Second, we are able to measure extremely precisely the social environment prevailing in 
départements.We construct a wealth of social, economic and demographic variables at the 
department level. In particular, we use multiple waves of the French Labor Survey and, more 
interestingly, various administrative data sets such as national Censuses, administrative and 
fiscal sources. Then, these measures are matched to our crime statistics. For instance, we 
believe that our very precise measures of urbanization (such as city size or population 
density), of social interaction (such as the part of people living in single-parent families), or of 
département income structure are relevant controls in order to study criminal behavior: for the 
United States, Glaeser and Scheinkman (1996), and Glaeser and Sacerdote (1999) found that 
social interactions mattered in their analysis of criminal behavior.  
 
Third, as the effect of unemployment is often ambiguous, we divide the unemployed into 
various categories that should have different propensities to commit crime. We directly 
measure youth unemployment as well as unemployment of older workers. We also measure 
the fraction of unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits and unemployment 
duration. Of course, because today’s crime may well generate tomorrow’s unemployment – if 
companies move away from crime-prone zones – unemployment is likely to be endogenous in 
our crime regressions. Therefore, we use the predicted rather than the observed industrial 
structure to instrument unemployment, an apparently consensual strategy (see Blanchard and 
Katz, 1992) if such a thing was ever possible for any set of instruments. And, indeed, our 
results suggest that increases in youth unemployment may well cause increases in crime, 
because education or work does not pay enough, in particular for the unskilled or low-
educated youth.1
 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the general trends in crime rates and 
unemployment in France. Section 3 presents a simple choice model of crime activity wth two 
types (age groups) of individuals: potential offenders vs. potential victims. In Section 4, we 
introduce the data, the basic model, and estimation methods. Results are reported and 
discussed in Section 5. Section 6 concludes. 
 
 
                                                 
1 In a recent paper, Bowles and Jayadev (2005) put emphasis on the labor disciplining effect of unemployment, 
but they recognize that the consequences of unemployment extend well beyond this disciplining effect, 
especially because the unemployment rate influences directly social phenomena such as property crime. 
 5
2. Trends in Crime Rates and Unemployment 
 
The aggregate crime data used in this study are collected annually at the département level by 
the local Police and Gendarmerie authorities. There are 95 départements in France. Each has 
approximately the same size but different populations. They roughly correspond to an 
American county. For historical reasons, the body in charge of ensuring security differs 
between urban areas, which are “police zones”, and rural areas, which are “gendarmerie 
zones”. Policemen’ status is civilian but gendarmerie is a military corps. Both gendarmes and 
policemen have to record the number of reported crimes in their respective zones. Then, the 
Ministry of Interior collects the data in each zone for each département and publishes the total 
number of offences at the département level. So these data cover all the French population. 
We restrict attention to the so-called “départements de France métropolitaine”, excluding 
overseas territories, but including Corsica. Data are available for the years 1990-2000. Using 
département-level population data obtained from the French statistical institute (INSEE), we 
calculated crime rates, measured as offences per 100,000 people. 
 
For a crime to be included in these administrative data, it must be first reported to the police 
or the gendarmerie, who must then file an official report of the event. Offences are reported 
for property crimes (armed or violent robberies, burglaries, car or motorbike thefts, thefts of 
objects from cars, shoplifting, pick-pocketing, receiving stolen goods), for violent crimes 
(homicides, voluntary wounds, blackmails, threats, sex offences, family offences) and some 
other crimes (drug offences, damage to vehicle, illegal weapon ownership, violence against 
police). In the case of violent crimes, one crime is counted for each victim, while for property 
crimes one crime is reported for each event regardless of the number of victims (except for 
pick-pocketing and shoplifting for which one crime is recorded for each victim). For the types 
of crimes we study, the classification remained unchanged since 1990.  
 
Table 1 shows the levels and the geographical variability of crimes rates for each available 
type of offence in 1990 and 2000. Property crimes are the most numerous and vary a lot 
across départments (especially pick-pocketing and violent robberies). On the contrary violent 
crimes such as sex offences or family offences show little spatial variability. 
 
 6
Figures 1, 2 and 3 depict the trends in these crimes rates for the period 1990-2000. The 
differences between these trends justify our choice to break up crime into precise categories 
instead of studying one aggregate index. Property crimes such as car thefts, thefts of objects 
from cars, shoplifting or burglaries first increased from 1990 to 1993, and then declined 
slowly, in contrast to what is often written in the French press. For example, burglaries 
declined by 8% between 1990 and 2000. Only armed or violent robberies increased 
dramatically (by 74%) during the same period. They follow the same pattern as violent 
crimes: except for homicides, all types of violent crimes (including damages to vehicles, 
illegal weapon ownership and violence against police) increased during the last decade. 
Blackmails and threats tripled and the rate of voluntary wounds doubled. Even if they account 
for little in the total reported crimes, these violent crimes are the most likely to influence the 
feeling of insecurity, as discussed in the media. 
 
Little has been said about the spatial correlations of crimes rates. Table A.1 in Appendix A 
examines these correlations for 2000. All categories of crime are highly correlated. 
Départements where property crime rates are high also have very high violent crime rates. 
This suggests that our crime categories have some common determinants, as shown in section 
4. Most correlations between growth rates for the period 1990-2000 are positive but some are 
not significant or even negative (Table A.2); a pattern potentially due to substitution between 
crimes (see Koskela and Virén, 1997, for an occupational choice model of crime switching, 
and some empirical evidence). 
 
These data are the most frequently cited measures of the extent of crime in France. They are 
also the most frequently criticized by the media as being contaminated by multiple biases. 
Indeed, their capacity to reflect real trends in crime rates depends on the reporting behavior of 
victims and the recording behavior of policemen and gendarmes. 
 
Indeed, not all crimes are reported to the police and, unfortunately, administrative data only 
take into account reported crimes. Victimization surveys provide a better measure of the 
“true” number of crimes (reported or not to the police). Indeed, some studies show that 
different sources may exhibit different trends: for the US, Bogess and Bound (1993) found 
that administrative data from the Uniform Crime Report (UCR) suggested a mild increase in 
crime during the 1980s, while the National Crime Survey depicted lower criminal activity 
over this period. Therefore, we also use such a survey, conducted by the French Statistical 
 7
Institute (INSEE). We use this survey for the years 1996 to 2002. Roughly 6,000 households 
and 11,000 individuals are interviewed every year. For each household, we have information 
on burglaries and car thefts. For each individual, the survey records information on thefts, 
personal attacks, as well as the feeling of insecurity. This survey also gives information on 
reporting of each incident to the police or the gendarmerie, and, if not reported, the reason for 
non-reporting the event. 
 
By construction, crime rates measured with victimization surveys are significantly higher than 
their counterpart in administrative data. Over the period 1996-2002, 3.0 percent of French 
households were victims of a burglary; 13.5 percent had their car or something in their car 
stolen. During the years 1997-2002, 8.5 percent of individuals (more than 15 years old) were 
wounded, insulted or threatened whereas 4.8 percent were affected by pick pocketing. 
 
The reporting rate (Figure 4) depends on the type of crime. Less serious crimes have a lower 
probability of being reported to the police than more serious crimes. According to the survey, 
the types of events most likely to be reported to the police are burglaries and vehicle thefts. In 
2002, 80 percent of burglary victimizations and 64 percent of car thefts (or thefts of objects in 
car) were brought to the attention of the police. Indeed these events affect the most valuable 
possessions of the victims who are required to report it to obtain compensation from their 
insurance company. By contrast, in 2002, 53 percent of personal larcenies, and 29 percent of 
voluntary wounds, insults, and threats were reported to the police.  
 
Administrative data are easier to use if reporting rates do not change over time. According to 
Figure 4, these rates remained stable over the period 1996-2002. And the trends in 
victimization rates (Figures 5 et 6) seem to fit the trends in administrative crime rates, even 
though the categories in the two data sources are not exactly similar. According to the 
victimization surveys, burglaries and car thefts declined by 30 percent between 1996 and 
2002, while larcenies increased by 40 percent. 
 
Finally, Figure 7 reports changes in the unemployment rates by age categories during the 
1990s. A noticeable fact is the high youth unemployment rate in France, compared to similar 
countries. During the years 1994-1997 it hits a peak (virtually 30 percent of the 15-24 years 
old labor force was unemployed). After 1998 it declined (20 percent in 2002). Unemployment 
rates for other age categories follow the same general trend but are considerably lower. 
 8
Trends in crime rates and in unemployment rates obviously differ. This apparent discrepancy 
led Prime Minister Jospin to confess his naivety. But, this should not stop us from analyzing 
our data. 
 
3. A Simple Choice Model of Crime Activity 
 
 
In most papers, the effect of unemployment on crime is often seen as ambiguous. With a 
simple choice model of crime activity, involving two populations with different propensities 
to commit crime, we propose a theoretical explanation for this ambiguity. As empirically 
most “economic” crimes (such as thefts) are committed by young people, whereas homicides 
or sexual offences are more likely to be committed by older delinquents (figure 8), this will 
lead us to study separately the effect of youth unemployment. 
 
Let us consider a population composed of two groups of persons, potential offenders (for 
example, young persons) and potential victims (for example, adult persons). Persons in these 
two groups are indexed by 0 and 1, respectively. The model is static. For a type-j individual, a 
licit activity corresponds to the occupation of a regular job which is associated with a wage 
equal to wj (j = 0, 1). A type-j individual is unemployed with positive probability pj (j = 0, 1). 
When a type-j person is unemployed, she receives an unemployment insurance benefit whose 
amount is a fixed fraction αj of her wage. An illicit activity consists in an assault on a type-1 
individual who may be either unemployed with probability p1 or employed at wage w1 with 
probability (1-p1). This assault yieds a fraction β of the victim’s wage, and the probability of 
an assault success (which corresponds to the probability not to get arrested and to be put in 
jail) is equal to q. The disutility associated with a failure (i.e. a capture followed by a penal 
sanction) is equal to C. An income level R, which may be obtained either legally or illegally 
by a type-0 individual, provides her with an (indirect) utility U(R) = ln R, the logarithmic 
specification implying here that the relative risk-aversion of this person is constant. 
Correspondingly, we assume that the logarithm of the regular market wage of a potential 
offender has a normal distribution with mean μ0 and variance σ0. In other terms, ln w0 = μ0 + 
ε0 , where the random term ε0 has a normal distribution N(0, σ0). 
 9
The expected utility associated with a licit activity for a type-0 individual is : 
 
E0 = p0 U(α0 w0) + (1 - p0) U(w0) = ln w0 + p0 ln α0 = μ0 + ε0 + p0 ln α0 . 
 
For the same person, the expected utility associated with an illicit activity is : 
 
E1 = - qC + (1-q) [p1 U(β α1 w1) + (1 – p1) U(β w1)] = - qC + (1-q) [ln β + ln w1 + p1 ln α1]. 
 
A type-0 individual chooses an illicit activity if E1 > E0. The probability of this event is : 
 
Pr[E1 > E0] = PI = Pr {ε0 < (1-q) [ln β + ln w1 + p1 ln α1] - μ0 - p0 ln α0 - qC }

In other terms, the probability for a type-0 individual (say, a young person) to choose an illicit 
activity is, other things being equal, increasing with the youth unemployment rate and with 
the wage level of type-1 individuals (say, adults). It decreases with the mean wage level 
offered to young workers and with the unemployment rate of adult workers. 
 10
 4. Data Set 
 
In this study we construct a regional-level data set (for the 95 départements of metropolitan 
France) with measures of crimes as reported to the Ministry of Interior. We then match this 
data set with various socio-economic indicators. These indicators were constructed at the 
département level (to be matched to our panel).  
First, to assess social conditions prevailing in the département that year, we constructed 
social, economic and demographic variables using multiple waves of the French Labor Force 
data. In March of every year the French Statistical Institute (INSEE) conducts a Labor Force 
Survey (Enquête sur l’Emploi), interviewing roughly 130,000 people who are asked a set of 
standard questions that are repeated every year. In particular, we know for each individual his 
or her département of residence. We use the Labor Force Survey for the years 1990 to 2000; 
most variables of interest are available every year. So for each département and year, we 
construct averages of the following variables: fraction of foreigners coming from North 
Africa, fraction of other foreigners, an age structure vector (fraction of 15-24 years old, of 25 
to 49, above 50), a family vector (fractions of men living alone, of people living in single-
parent families), an education vector (fractions of high school graduates, of unskilled people) 
and a city structure vector (the share of persons leaving in rural areas, in cities with less than 
20,000 inhabitants, in cities between 20,000 and 200,000 inhabitants, in cities with more than 
200,000 inhabitants, in Paris and suburbs). In addition, we use the industry structure at the 
department-level from 1986 to 2000 to construct predicted employment shares that will be 
used as instrumental variables (described below). 
 
As unemployment is the core issue of our paper, we chose to measure it with very precise 
administrative data instead of using the Labor Force Survey. The French Public Employment 
Service provided us with département-level data sets with the number of unemployed by age 
categories, the share of unemployed above 25 years old not receiving unemployment benefits, 
and the number of those unemployed since more than one year. To focus even more closely 
on the young, we also compute shares of students and employed among the 15 to 24 years old 
from the French Labor Force Survey. We also use other administrative data sets available at 
the département-level. The number of policemen was obtained from INSEE, while the 
number of gendarmes was obtained from the Ministry of Defence. 
 11
 5. Empirical Findings 
 
5.1 OLS analysis 
 
Most of our results at the regional level of the département are based on variants of the 
following equation: 
 
 
                        ( ) ittiititit UXCR εδαγβ ++++=ln                               (1) 
 
where CR denotes the crime rate in département i at date t, where X denotes observed 
characteristics of the population, of the urban structure, U denotes the unemployment rate. 
Most of the time, we include time indicators and département fixed-effects. Finally, the last 
term of (1) is a statistical residual.  
 
Table 2 presents the results for the basic specification. Each row shows results for a different 
crime. The first three columns present respectively the estimate for the unemployment 
coefficient, the standard error of this coefficient, and the R-square of the regression without 
time and département indicators. The last three columns present the estimate for the 
unemployment coefficient, the standard error of this coefficient, and the R-square of the 
regression with time and département indicators. All regressions include socio-demographic 
controls: fraction of foreigners coming from North Africa, of other foreigners, fraction of 
people aged 15 to 24, 25 to 49, of men living alone, of individuals in single-parent families, of 
individuals without any diploma, of high school graduates, of those living in rural areas, of 
those living in cities between 20,000 and 200,000 inhabitants, of those living in cities with 
more than 200,000 inhabitants, and finally those leaving in Paris and its suburbs. Département 
populations are used as weights. 
 
First, considering the R-square column for the first set of regressions, two facts emerge. As 
predicted by the Becker’s rational model of crime, property crime is better explained than 
violent crime or family crime (see Kelly, 2000 for a similar observation). Second, all R-
squares are very large, even without the département or time indicators. A simple comparison 
 12
with wage regressions, where R-squares are lower than 0.3 in the cross-section and, therefore, 
observed characteristics appear to be less important than unobserved ones in wage analysis, 
shows that observable characteristics of the regions matter for crime. Third, in the cross-
section, unemployment is positively associated to crime. A deeper statistical examination of 
these results (not reported, but available from the authors) in association with the impact of 
other variables on crime demonstrates that these cross-section results are entirely governed 
by the opposition between rural and urban départements. Fourth, and in contrast to the third 
point, unemployment is, in general, negatively associated to crime in the panel dimension. 
This is most often true for property or, more generally, economic crimes (burglaries, most 
thefts, or drug offences). Fifth, violent crimes (homicides, threats, violence against police 
forces) appear to be positively associated to unemployment. Hence, if they are the driving 
force of the insecurity feeling, Jospin was not totally wrong after all. 
 
The following Tables are mere variations on this theme. Table 3 has the same structure as 
Table 2 but contrasts unemployment by age categories. Focusing on the estimates with region 
fixed effects, we see that youth unemployment has a positive impact on most crimes whereas 
unemployment for the two other age categories have a negative impact on most crimes. This 
set of results is much more in agreement with the popular view of crime, but also with a 
simple choice model of crime activity (see Appendix B). Indeed, those categories of crime for 
which the coefficient on youth unemployment is negative or not significantly different from 
zero – car thefts, homicides, pick-pocketing, shoplifting, blackmail, rapes, family offences – 
are clearly not youth-specific in contrast to, say, drug offences, motorbikes thefts, or 
burglaries.  
 
Table 4 goes a step further and tries to identify the effects of unemployment benefits on 
crime. The structure of the Table is the following. Each row presents the results of two 
regressions. First, to the unemployment structure by age, we add the fraction of workers 
above 25 who are unemployed and do not receive unemployment benefits (specification (1)). 
Second, to the unemployment structure by age, we add the fraction of workers above 25 who 
are long-term unemployed (specification (2)). For this second regression, we only report the 
coefficient on the long-term unemployed variable since all other coefficients are virtually 
identical to those reported for specification (1). Results show that, indeed, not receiving UI 
benefits appear to be positively associated to almost all economic crimes. These results stand 
 13
in stark contrast to those of specification (2) since there is no association between crime and 
long-term unemployment. 
 
Some institutional details are in order. First, most young workers are not eligible to 
unemployment benefits. Second, a non-negligible fraction of workers above 25 are not 
eligible to unemployment benefits, for instance because they did not work enough hours in 
the preceding year or because they were previously self-employed. Third, a large fraction of 
long-term unemployed receive UI benefits. In conclusion, the positive coefficients on youth 
unemployment and on non-reception of benefits for workers above 25 are the two faces of the 
same coin. Reception of benefits appears to decrease the incentives to commit economic 
crimes, conditional of course on unemployment. 
 
Tables 5 and 6 test the robustness of these results by including a measure of the median wage 
and a measure of inequality (Q3/Q1 of the wage distribution) in the département (Table 5) 
and the number of policemen and of gendarmes (same role as police, mostly in rural areas, the 
gendarmes belong to the army in contrast to the police who is part of the Ministry of Interior). 
In addition to confirming the robustness of our previous results, estimates presented in Table 
5 show that there is no relation between wages and economic crime (even though there are 
some evidence that sex offences tend to happen in poorer areas). Furthermore, there is no 
relation between wage inequality and economic crime.2
 
Results shown in Table 6 are once again similar to those presented in the previous Tables. 
The presence of police is negatively associated to robberies, burglaries, and thefts. By 
contrast, the effect of gendarmes is less clear-cut; a potential reflection of the rural nature of 
their tasks3.  
 
                                                 
2 In unreported results, inspired by Gould et al. (2002), we estimated similar regressions with the fraction of low-
wage workers (among the young and the unskilled) as explanatory variables. None of these variables proved 
significantly different from zero.  
3 We were able to check some of these results at the city-level and the individual level. The French Ministry of 
Defence provided us with an aggregate crime rate (restricted to burglaries, robberies, larcenies, and thefts) at the 
city-level (covering 90 percent of the 36,000 French cities, belonging mostly to rural and semi-urban areas, 
where gendarmes are in charge of security). We matched this data set with various socio-economic indicators. 
Most of these results have the same flavor as those shown previously for the département-level analysis, in the 
cross-section dimension. In particular, when looking at the unemployment variables, youth unemployment seems 
to have a negative impact on crime. These results in fact contrast small rural communes with larger semi-urban 
cities. We also performed a similar analysis -with similar results- at the individual level, using our victimization 
survey matched with various socio-economic indicators. 
 14
5.2 Correlations across crimes 
 
A potential issue in our strategy is the following. We have examined crimes separately, one 
by one. Obviously, some crimes are related. For instance, in a violent burglary, wounds can 
also be inflicted to the victims. In addition, reporting strategies may vary. For instance, in 
quiet areas, shoplifting will be systematically reported to the police and registered whereas in 
more troubled places either shoplifting will not be systematically reported because it is too 
frequent, or even when the victim tries to report it to the authorities, the police might not have 
time to register the act. A first strategy to examine these problems is presented now. We 
compute the correlations between our various measures of crime across regions. This 
correlation Table, as well as those that follow, are given in the Appendix A. Results of Tables 
A.1 and A.2 show that economic crimes are very highly correlated across the French 
departments. Just note though that shoplifting is much less correlated to the rest of economic 
crimes. Furthermore, family offences seem also to behave differently, a result that is not 
surprising given that factors that affect this type of crime are obviously not governed by 
Becker’s model of rational crime. An examination of Table A.3 that presents correlations 
across growth rates for these same crimes confirms that economic crimes are very different 
from the rest. A relatively large fraction of these correlations are positive and significant in 
stark contrast with correlations between growth rates of other types of crimes. To understand 
the nature of the links between these various crimes, we decomposed each crime as described 
in equation (1). Then, we recuperate and estimate of iα  for each crime. First, we correlate 
these fixed effects across regions. Results are given in Table A.4. Most correlations are huge 
(and positive). Once again, shoplifting, family offences and sex offences stand in sharp 
contrast. Hence, the same unobserved fixed components explain the various crimes. The next 
stage is to understand the nature of these fixed components. Do they mostly pertain to 
observable characteristics of the département or to unobservables ? To examine this question, 
we first estimate the following equation:  
iii x υδα +=ˆ  
where the fixed effect for each crime is regressed on the same set of time-invariant variables 
(basically, the average of our variables from equation (1)). We do not report the R-square of 
these regressions but they are very large, between 0.6 and 0.9. Hence, observed factors 
explain a large fraction of the fixed effects. Then, we take the estimated iυ ’s and correlate 
them across crimes. The results are given in Table A.5. Once again, correlations are virtually 
 15
all significant, positive, and very large. Structural factors, some being associated to 
oppositions such as rural versus urban environments, explain the level of crime, irrespective 
of its type and nature.  
 
 
5.3 A causal approach 
 
Up to this point, we adopted a descriptive viewpoint. But, we obviously need to use a more 
causal approach. The basic problem is the following. Unemployment can be endogenous in a 
crime regression. Gould et al. (2002) presents the reason very clearly. If crime in a region 
induces firms to stop investing or even to start relocating their activities in less crime-prone 
regions, then unemployment and crime will be positively correlated because crime causes 
unemployment and not the reverse. The strategy that is usually applied, instrumental variables 
techniques, will also be applied in the following paragraphs.  
 
Our set of instruments is directly inspired by Gould et al. (2002).4 In their paper, these authors 
used the predicted industrial structure to instrument unemployment since those predictions, 
made at the beginning of the period, were obviously based on purely economic reasons with 
no room for crime considerations. Following them, we use as instrumental variables the 
components of the (predicted) change in demographic group g’s share of employment 
between date 0 and date t (t = 1, …,T) in département d. We consider three demographic 
groups (g = 1, 2, 3) based on age (15-24, 25-49 and more than 50 years old). The change in 
demographic group g’s share of employment between date 0 and date t in département d can 
be decomposed as follows: 
 
( ) ( )idgdtigi dtididtii idgdgdtg ffffffff 0000 −+−=− ∑∑                        (2) 
 
where: 
• fg| dti (respectively, fg| d0i ) denotes the demographic group g’s share of the employment 
in industry i at time t (respectively, at time 0) in département d, 
• fg| dt (respectively, fg| d0 ) denotes the demographic group g’s share of the employment 
at time t (respectively, at time 0) in département d, 
                                                 
4 See also Blanchard and Katz (1992). 
 16
• fi| dt (respectively, fi| d0 ) denotes industry i’s share of the employment at time t 
(respectively, at time 0) in département d. 
 
The first term on the r.h.s. of equation (2), called GROWg, represents the effects of industry 
growth rates, while the second term, called TECHg, reflects changes in each group’s share of 
employment within industries. Following Gould et al. (2002), in estimating each term, we 
replace the département-specific employment shares fg| dti and fg| d0i with national employment 
shares fg| ti and fg| 0i. We also replace the actual end of period shares fi| dt with estimates dtifˆ  
defined as: 
 
0
ˆ
i
ti
doidti f
f
ff =  
 
Our set of instruments includes the predicted effects of industry growth rates GROWg and 
their squares, for g = 1, 2 (it is easy to verify that Sg GROWg =  0, which implies that one 
element in the vector of instruments GROWg has to be excluded from the list of regressors in 
the instrumental regression). Values of theses 4 instruments are obtained from the French 
annual Labor Force Surveys collected by INSEE (Paris) between 1989 (t = 0) and 2000 (t = 
T). 
 
Results of these instrumenting regressions for two sets of instruments are presented in Tables 
7A and 7B. All our measures of unemployment are well correlated to the instruments (see the 
F-statistics). Gould et al. (2002) justify their instruments, in particular the within-industry 
growth rates of employment shares in the 4 demographic groups, by appealing to biased 
technical change. However, unreported results (available from the authors) show that the 
within industry growth rates (the TECH variables) do not seem to have a good predictive 
power, in contrast to the between-industry growth rates (the GROW variables). This is 
reminiscent of previous results on France showing that biased technical change appears less 
biased in France than in the United States (see Goux and Maurin, 2000 and Card, Kramarz, 
and Lemieux, 1999). To summarize, our first-stage results are quite satisfactory for our main 
variables of interest, the unemployment rates, when using predicted industry growth, by 
demographic or education group (with slightly larger F-statistics for instruments based on 
age).  
 17
 Tables 8A to 8B presents the IV results for our two sets of instruments. These Tables have the 
same format as those previously discussed. Sargan’s tests of the validity of the instruments 
are reported in the last two columns. Most test statistics support their (statistical) quality, in 
particular the instruments are deemed satisfactory in all crimes but four: motorbike thefts, 
homicides for both instruments, voluntary wounds, violence against police, blackmails, and 
illegal weapon ownership for one of the two. Hence, for only two crimes our IV estimates are 
not statistically reliable. These IV results confirm previous estimates. Youth unemployment 
has a clear (positive) effect on most economic crimes: robberies, burglaries, car thefts, thefts 
from cars, pick-pocketing, drug offences, damage to vehicles. The effects are often extremely 
large and significant. In addition, in unreported results (available again from the authors), it is 
only youth unemployment that positively affects crime; the fraction of students or the fraction 
of employed among the 15-24 years old has a statistically insignificant effect on crime (most 
often with negative signs, as expected). Therefore, the culprit is indeed youth unemployment 
which causes economic crimes. Finally, results in Table 8B (less so in Table 8A) show that 
the fraction of unemployed workers among the 25 to 49 years old has a strong negative, most 
often statistically significant, impact on crime (this variable is also instrumented, see Tables 
7A and 7B). If criminals are mostly found among the young, their targets appear to be the 
employed individuals. Hence, an increase in unemployment among the targets may cause a 
decrease in opportunities of profitable crime.  
 
To summarize these last results, youth unemployment has a positive and robust causal effect 
on most property crimes – robberies, burglaries, car thefts,… – and on drug offences when 
other types of violent crimes, such as rapes or homicides, appear to be unrelated to labor 
market conditions, in agreement with the Becker model of crime.  
 
6. Conclusion 
 
Our results demonstrate that most of the variation in criminality is between regions. They also 
show that the main reason for this is the opposition between mostly rural regions and mostly 
urban départements. Are such results a sound basis for a public policy trying to reduce 
crime ? One possibility is to follow Alphonse Allais who suggested 100 years ago to relocate 
cities in the countryside (“mettre les villes à la campagne”). Fortunately, there is also 
 18
variation within departments. In particular, our IV results suggest potential public policies 
against crime. Fighting youth unemployment should indeed help decreasing property crimes 
and drug offences. However, some other economic or violent crimes appear to be unrelated to 
labor market conditions as measured by unemployment. We have also reported evidence that 
it is indeed unemployment among the young, and not the young per se, that causes crime. To 
attract the young away from crime, there are multiple potential routes. Education is an 
obvious one. More specifically, education has to pay, either directly or indirectly. For the 
direct component, two ideas can be mentioned. First, apprentices receive – by law – miserable 
pay when doing their apprenticeship, which may explain that they are often used as cheap 
labor by firms without being effectively trained (see Fougère and Schwerdt, 2002). Second, 
experiments in Israel show that large bonuses targeted to the poor that are paid when the child 
succeeds at school seem to work (see for instance Angrist and Lavy, 2001). The indirect route 
is obviously longer investments in schooling with deferred compensations large enough to 
make the investment valuable. This is not an easy route in France where returns to a 
university education have decreased in the last 10 years (see Kramarz, Lemieux, Margolis, 
2002).

Each row presents the results of two regressions. The only reported coefficient is that of the unemployment variable. 
The first regression does not include time and département effects. The standard errors are between parentheses. 
Each observation is a département-year. 1,045 observations. The dependent variable is the logarithm of offenses 
rates (offenses per 100,000 people). Each regression also includes socio-demographic controls (fraction of foreigners 
coming from North Africa, of other foreigners, fraction of 15-24, of 25-49, of men living alone, of people in single-
parent families, of unskilled people, of high school graduates, of those living in rural areas, of those living in cities 
between 20,000 and 200,000, in cities above 200,000, in Paris and suburbs). Département population is used as 
weight.

Département fixed effects were obtained as follows. We regressed logarithms of offences rates (offences 100,000 people) on year and département fixed effects, socio-demographic 
controls (fraction of foreigners coming from North Africa, of other foreigners, fraction of 15-24, of 25-49, of unemployed among 15-24 yrs old, of unemployed among 25-49 yrs old, of 
unemployed among more than 50 yrs old, of unemployed not receiving UI among unemployed above 25, of men living alone, of people in single-parent families, of unskilled people, of high 
school graduates, of those living in rural areas, of those living in cities between 20,000 and 200,000, in cities above 200,000, in Paris and suburbs.
