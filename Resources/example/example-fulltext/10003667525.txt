What does excess bank liquidity say about  
the loan market in Less Developed Countries?
Tarron Khemraj
Abstract
Evidence about developing countries’ commercial banks’ liquidity preference suggests the following 
about their loan markets: (i) the loan interest rate is a minimum mark-up rate; (ii) the loan market 
is characterized by oligopoly power; and (iii) indirect monetary policy, a cornerstone of financial 
liberalization, can only be effective at very high interest rates that are likely to be deflationary. 
The minimum rate is a mark-up over a foreign interest rate, marginal transaction costs and a risk 
premium. A calibration exercise demonstrates that the hypothesis of a minimum mark-up loan rate 
is consistent with the observed stylized facts.

What does excess bank liquidity say about  
the loan market in Less Developed Countries?
Tarron Khemraj
The financial liberalization hypothesis holds that allowing the market determination of real interest rates 
would mobilize savings and increase deposits (Fry, 1997a). Commercial banks—that are able to select good 
from bad borrowers, diversify risks, minimize transaction costs, etc—would then channel these savings to 
the best investors who earn the highest rate of return. Performing such roles of intermediation, banks not 
only increase the rate of capital accumulation but also increase productivity, thereby boosting the economy’s 
steady-state growth (Bencivenga and Smith, 1991).
However, in many less developed countries, banks hold large quantities of excess liquidity—a large 
part of which is non-remunerative—in their asset portfolio (Saxegard, 2006; Khemraj, 2006; Fielding and 
Shorthand, 2005). For the remainder of this paper, excess liquidity is defined as total bank liquidity minus 
required bank liquidity. The required liquidity (or reserve) ratio is set by the central bank in the individual 
country. Excess liquidity is usually non-remunerated.
In spite of efforts to liberalize and modernize financial institutions, markets and instruments in 
LDCs, the banking sector is the most important source of financing in these economies and it is likely to 
continue to be that way indefinitely (Stiglitz, 1989; Singh, 1997). Therefore, the investment choice of banks 
can either retard finance’s role in growth or augment that role. Hence, examining banks’ liquidity preference 
in LDCs will emphasize important information regarding their behaviour in such economies.
This paper posits the hypothesis that banks in LDCs require a minimum rate of interest in the 
loan market before they make a specific loan. A bank must receive a minimum loan rate that compensates 
for risks, marginal transaction costs and the rate of return on a safe foreign asset before it makes a loan to a 
particular borrower. If the marginal borrower is unwilling to pay the minimum rate, then the banks accumu-
late non-remunerative excess liquidity1. This phenomenon is depicted by a liquidity preference curve that is 
flat at a relatively high loan rate. Therefore, non-remunerative excess liquidity and loans can become perfect 
substitutes at a very high rate of interest in the loan market. The paper will demonstrate that such behaviour 
is consistent with a loan market that is oligopolistic. Moreover, to present its case, the paper utilizes the in-
dustrial organization banking model of Klein (1971) and Freixas and Rochet (1999). The model will also be 
modified to suit the institutional characteristics of underdeveloped economies.
A key implication of this study for policy is the postulation that commercial banks set the loan rate 
exogenously via a mark-up over the marginal transaction costs and the exogenous safe rate of interest2. It there-
1 The obvious question would be why banks still hold unremunerated liquidity given that the foreign rate is the 
opportunity cost. There are likely to be several factors that preclude banks from doing so. The first is a shortage of 
foreign exchange in the domestic foreign currency market. This is a foreign currency constraint. The constraint can be 
unofficially maintained by the central bank when it accumulates international reserves by buying up US dollars in the 
local currency market. This behaviour was found in Khemraj (2006) in the Guyana case. A further research agenda 
would be to find out whether the foreign currency constraint is a key factor accounting for excess unremunerated 
liquidity in other developing countries. Explicit capital controls would be another reason why banks would demand 
the unremunerated liquidity. 
2 The same argument can be made about the deposit market and market for government bonds and Treasury bills. That 
issue, however, is beyond the scope of this paper and is the subject of further research.

fore means that a liquidity shock emanating from the central bank will not elicit a response in the interest rate 
over the flat section of the banks’ liquidity preference curve. This is important for LDCs that have been imple-
menting indirect (or market-based) monetary policy as a means of influencing bank credit—and ultimately 
consumption and investment decisions—by managing excess reserves and/or a short-term interest rate3.
Indirect monetary policy is often seen as a precondition for the adoption of inflation targeting—or 
at least a milder version of inflation targeting known as inflation targeting ‘lite’ (Stone, 2003)—in LDCs. 
Monetary policy shocks—characterized by shifts in the excess reserves supply curve through open market 
operations—are only likely to be effective at even higher loan rates (above the minimum rate at which the 
excess liquidity preference curve is horizontal) when the liquidity preference curve is downward sloping. 
High interest rates, however, can contribute to economic stagnation even after significant efforts have been 
made in liberalizing and developing financial systems in developing countries.
The paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the stylized facts that depict the liquid-
ity preference curves in the eight countries. The following section develops a banking model that helps to 
explain the stylized facts. The model is used to make theoretical statements regarding banks’ response to 
central bank monetary policy shocks. The penultimate section performs a calibration exercise to buttress the 
core proposition of the research. The fifth section concludes.
Stylized Facts
This section utilizes the technique of locally weighted polynomial regressions (LOESS) of degree one in 
order to extract bank liquidity preference curves for eight less developed countries4. The sample of countries 
is based on primarily two factors. Firstly, the country must be known to have a very liquid banking sector. 
Secondly, the relevant data for the analysis must be available over a long enough time period. The African 
countries chosen in this paper were also included in the sample of Saxegaard (2006). Egypt is also included 
because Fielding and Shorthand (2005) analyzed excess bank liquidity and political violence in that country. 
The Caribbean countries are all included in the work of Khemraj (2006).
Each figure below plots bank liquidity (in local currency) against the loan rate. However, for three 
of the countries—Egypt, Uganda and Namibia—data on the level of excess bank liquidity is unavailable. 
However, bank liquidity is represented by total bank reserves (the summation of required and excess) taken 
from the International Financial Statistics (IFS). The loan rate series for each country was also sourced from 
the IFS. The level of excess liquidity for the other five countries comes directly from the respective central 
bank statistical report. In each case, the nominal interest rate is utilized5.
3 Alexander, et al. (1995: 2) define direct versus indirect monetary policy instruments. Direct instruments set or limit 
prices (interest rates) or quantity (credit). The quantity-based direct instruments often place restrictions on commercial 
banks’ balance sheet. Hence, they are associated with financial repression. Indirect instruments, in contrast, operate 
through the market by influencing the demand and supply conditions of commercial bank reserves. 
4 The local regressions are extremely useful for deciphering underlying nonlinear relationships. The technique was first 
proposed by Cleveland (1979) and further developed by Cleveland and Devlin (1988). Only a subset of observations 
within a neighbourhood of the point to fit the curve is used. The regression is weighted so that observations further 
from the given data point are given less weight. The subset of data used in each weighted least squares fit is αN, where 
α = the smoothing parameter and N = number of data points. A higher parameter, α, gives a smoother fit. 
Throughout the exercise a smoothing parameter of 0.3 is used.
5 The nominal interest rate is used throughout the analysis. This is because the real interest rate does not 
change the conclusion since if inflation is important for the banks, they would want to get rid of all non-
remunerative assets. This is clearly not the case since the data confirm that the banking sectors in these 
economies have always been liquid. 
What  does excess bank l iquid i ty  say  about  the  loan market  in  LDCs?          3
There are two clear tendencies in the figures: (i) the fitted liquidity preference curves tend to become 
flat6; and (ii) the flatness occurs at a relatively very high rate of interest. This means the elasticity of demand 
for bank excess liquidity is perfectly elastic (or approaches perfect elasticity) at a loan rate significantly above 
zero. Banks in these economies view loans and unproductive excess liquidity as perfect (or near perfect) 
substitutes at very high loan rates.
In the case of Guyana, the bank’s liquidity preference curve becomes flat at approximately 16 per 
cent. This implies that a bank will not lend, on average, to the marginal borrower if that borrower cannot 
pay at least 16 per cent. The same can be said for Barbados where the curve becomes flat at around 8.5 per 
cent. In the case of Jamaica, commercial banks will not lend to the marginal borrower who wishes to pay a 
rate below 18 per cent. The marginal borrower in Uganda will find credit difficult to come by if he or she is 
unwilling to borrow at around 20 per cent. In Trinidad and Tobago the curve becomes flat at 10.5 per cent; 
while in Egypt the minimum rate seems to be approximately 13 per cent. The Bahamas has the lowest mini-
mum loan rate at approximately 6 per cent.
Under a perfectly competitive loan market—an assumption that is implicitly made in the financial 
liberalization literature (see Arestis and Demetriades, 1999)—excess liquidity and bank loans should become 
substitutes at a zero loan rate. The fact that they are substitutes at a very high rate implies the banking sector 
in our selected economies (and very likely other underdeveloped economies also) is far from the case of com-
petition. This paper makes the realistic assumption that the banking sector is oligopolistic and not competi-
tive. As oligopolies, banks are able to mark-up the loan rate over an exogenous benchmark rate, transaction 
costs, and also take into consideration any risk of default associated with a specific borrower.
6 It might be tempting to view the flat liquidity preference curves as indicative of a liquidity trap. However, that is not 
the case for two reasons: (i) the analysis uses the loan rate rather than the safe government bond/Treasury bill rate; 
and (ii) the curves tend to become flat at a very high rate of interest. There is a liquidity trap when money and bonds 
become perfect substitutes at zero bond/Treasury bill rate.

Oligopoly Banking and Monetary Policy
This section of the paper has two objectives: (i) to present an oligopoly banking model from which the mini-
mum loan rate can be derived; and (ii) to use the model to demonstrate to what extent indirect monetary 
policy shocks can influence the interest rate in the loan market.
Banks are assumed to possess market power in the loan market and the government Treasury bill 
market. The monopoly banking model was first introduced by Klein (1971) and later applied to a liquid-
ity management model under uncertainty by Prisman, Slovin and Sushka (1986). However, an important 
difference between the model in this paper and earlier banking models is the fact that the government bond 
(or Treasury bill) market is not perfectly competitive as was originally postulated by Klein (1971), Slovin and 
Sushka (1983), Prisman, Slovin and Sushka (1986), and Freixas and Rochet (1999). While the government 
security market is likely to be highly developed and liquid in the advanced economies—hence the individual 
bank accepts this rate as given—it is not the case in LDCs where few institutional investors, mainly banks, 
dominate the purchase of Treasury bills. Therefore, the individual bank faces an upward sloping Treasury bill 
supply curve, thus making the bank an oligopsonist. If the Treasury bill market is uncompetitive, then the 
Treasury bill yield cannot be used as the exogenous reference rate which pins down the domestic term struc-
ture (as was the case in the papers cited immediately above). The discount rate is another candidate rate that 
can serve as the exogenous reference rate since it is clearly exogenous and under the control of the central 
bank. However, given the persistence of excess liquidity, this rate has not been very useful to signal monetary 
policy stance since banks seldom borrow reserves from the central bank.
As noted earlier, a key aspect of financial liberalization is the development of the money market in 
which the “independent” central bank will implement indirect monetary policy (IMF/World Bank, 2001; 
Fry, 1997b, chapter 6). To achieve this objective a primary market is developed for government Treasury

bills, which a central bank can use to pursue open market operations7. In some countries such as Jamaica (see 
Peart, 1995) the central bank creates its own open market instrument. However, in most cases the Treasury 
bill auction system is the principal way of controlling bank excess reserves. Steps are then taken to develop 
the secondary market for Treasury bills and the inter-bank market for excess bank reserves.
In light of the very open nature of the economies under study (and LDCs in general), bank manag-
ers must always be mindful, subject to suitable adjustments for real exchange rate risks, of the prevailing rate 
of interest on foreign assets (which can be represented by the US Treasury bill rate or the LIBOR). Bank 
managers need to compare the international rate (adjusted for real exchange rate movements) with the pre-
vailing domestic Treasury bill rate and the loan rate (also adjusted for domestic risk scenarios and transaction 
costs).
The non-bank public must also consider the international safe rate and exchange rate movements 
when making investment decisions particularly in domestic deposit accounts. Banks will lose deposits and 
market share if the deposit rate becomes too low vis-à-vis the risk adjusted foreign rate. The existence of such 
an arbitrage mechanism in an unregulated open economy provides for a link between the asset and liability 
sides (of the bank’s balance sheet) in a banking model even though domestic financial markets are subjected 
to market power. Therefore, the foreign interest rate, which is clearly exogenous to the domestic economy, 
can be used as the exogenous reference rate in the modelling exercise. Hence, the model is applied in an 
open economy environment, thereby accounting for another important difference between the approach of 
this paper and the traditional banking model that is mainly presented in a closed economy setting.
Equation 1 is the representative bank’s profit function that is assumed to be concave in loans to the 
private sector (L); domestic government securities (G); and deposits (D). The i subscript attached to each 
variable signals the quantity of the respective variable held by the representative bank. Other key variables 
include Lr = the average loan rate; Dr = average deposit rate; Fr = rate of interest on the international security 
(the LIBOR for instance); ( )ic L = transaction and monitoring costs associated with making loans to private 
agents; ρ = the proportion of borrowers (where 0 1ρ≤ ≤ ) who are likely to default on their loans; and ψ
= the probability (where 0 1ψ≤ ≤ ) that the government will fail to meet its debt obligations . The latter 
probability, for instance, is a function of the debt-GDP ratio or some other measure of debt sustainability. 
The bank’s balance sheet identity in which zD = required reserves (where z = ratio of total excess and required 
liquidity) is given by the identity equation 2.

Following Freixas and Rochet (1999), the paper assumes a Cournot oligopoly. In the Cournot equilibrium 
the ith bank maximizes profit by taking the volume of loans, Treasury bills, and deposits of other banks as 
given. In other words, for the ith bank, * * *( , , )i i iL G D , solves equation 3. Equation (3a) denotes the aggregate 
quantity of loans, Treasury bills and deposits demanded, respectively, by the entire banking sector.
The loan market
It is now possible to derive a pricing equation for the representative bank in the loan market. Equation 4 is 
the first order condition after maximizing the profit function with respect to iL . The market demand curve 
the bank faces is downward sloping thus giving the elasticity of demand expression in equation (4c) in which 
Lε denotes the elasticity of demand. Bank i accounts for the fraction Lis out of the industry’s total quantity 
of loans (4b). The expression ( )Lr L′ represents the first derivative of the loan rate with respect to L. As dem-
onstrated by (4a) it is simply the inverse of ( )LL r′ .

( ) /L L Lr L r Lε ′= ⋅        (4c)
Upon substituting 4a, 4b and 4c into the first order condition, equation 5 is obtained. The equation shows 
that the loan rate is a mark-up over the foreign rate and the marginal cost of transacting, ( )ic L′ . The mark-
up is dependent on the market elasticity of demand and the share of the individual bank’s demand for loan 
out of the total for the industry. As 1Lis →  there is the case of a monopoly and the mark-up is highest, 
while as 0Lis →  one bank has an infinitesimal share of the market; the equilibrium approaches the com-
petitive state in which the mark-up approaches zero. The bank also increases the mark-up rate once the 
perceived probability of default increases (that is 1ρ → ).
         (5)
This equation helps to explain the existence of a minimum loan rate, at which point excess liquidity and 
private loans become perfect substitutes; hence, it explains the flattening of the empirical liquidity preference 
curve that was observed in the last section. Since the bank possesses the ability to choose a minimum rate, it 
will simply accumulate excess liquidity when the marginal borrower cannot pay the desired minimum loan 
rate. In other words, the bank accumulates excess liquidity because the marginal benefit from the additional 
unit of loan is less than the marginal cost of that same unit of loan. The minimum rate also implies that the 
removal of financial repression8 will result in very high loan rates as banks behave more like theoretical oli-
gopolies. High loan rates, especially after the liberalization of financial systems, have been observed in many 
developing countries (see Chirwa and Mlachila, 2004).
8 Fry (1982) explains the main forms of financial repression as nominal interest rate ceilings for deposit and loan rates, 
directed credit to particular industries, and the expropriation by government of seigniorage by the use of high cash and 
liquid asset requirements and obligatory holding of government securities.

Treasury bill market
As noted earlier the commercial banks do not take the domestic Treasury bill rate as given. With only a few 
large institutional purchasers of government securities, it is reasonable to assume that buyers do exert influ-
ence over the Treasury bill rate when they place bids for the security. In other words, banks face an upward 
sloping supply curve rather than a flat curve as is typically assumed in the literature. It is also a reasonable 
assumption to make since banks usually demand excess liquid assets over the stipulated statutory secondary 
liquidity ratio. Banks do find these assets desirable (hence the excess amounts) since they can collude and 
control the rate at which they bid for Treasury bills. Therefore, the Treasury bill rate can also be derived as a 
mark-up over the international rate.
             (6)
Maximizing the profit function with respect to iG  gives the first order condition in equation 6. Substitute 6a, 
6b and 6c into equation 6 to obtain the new pricing equation 7. The equation postulates that the minimum 
Treasury bill rate at which a bank will bid for the security is denoted by a mark-up over the exogenous foreign 
rate and market-specific risk. The minimum mark-up rate increases as 1Gis →  (where Gis  is the share of total 
outstanding bills bought by bank i). The minimum rate also increases as 1ψ → , hence the bank will bid at a 
higher rate once the likelihood of a government default increases. This result is also consistent with the notion 
that a market Treasury bill rate that is below the minimum stipulated by the mark-up rule will result in the 
bank accumulating excess reserves passively9. However, this issue is beyond the scope of this paper and is left 
to further research. Another issue that is not taken up in this paper is the derivation of the deposit rate.

Indirect monetary policy and the loan market
It is interesting to see the extent to which indirect monetary policy can influence the loan rate when banks 
use a mark-up pricing rule to determine both the loan rate and the rate of interest on the government secu-
rity. The main task of indirect monetary policy in LDCs is the management of excess bank reserves through 
some form of open market operations using government Treasury bills, which the central bank holds as asset. 
The following arguments, however, are equally valid when the central bank invents its own open market 
instrument as in Jamaica.
So far, the paper has argued that excess liquidity is a structural phenomenon rooted in the oligopoly 
nature of banking. The task ahead is to now derive a theoretical equation to show the extent to which open 
market operations would influence the loan rate and hence bank credit and the real side of the economy. In 
particular, the objective is to analyze the effect on Lr when the central bank manages bank liquidity by vary-
9 The evidence of horizontal liquidity preference curves when the domestic Treasury bill rate is used is not included in 
this paper given the focus on the loan market. This is more the issue of the money market.

ing the quantity of G. G is the policy variable; hence it is exogenous. The loan rate ( Lr ) is the endogenous 
variable in the model. An increase in the sale of Treasury bills (G) is indicative of monetary tightening and a 
concomitant increase in Gr (that is: ( ) 0Gr G′ > ); the opposite occurs when the sale of G declines.
It is possible to combine equations 5 and 7, which both have the common term Fr , to form equa-
tion 8. Taking the derivative /Ldr dG  will produce the impact equation 9. The loan rate is affected posi-
tively by a monetary contraction (increased sales of G) and negatively by a monetary expansion (decrease 
sales of G). However, the pass-through effect is weakened given the oligopolistic nature of the loan market. 
As 1Lis →  the effect gets smaller; while it gets stronger as 0Gis → , which in turn implies that as banks bid 
up the government security rate the loan rate will also rise to maintain the positive correlation between asset 
returns. Note, however, that at the point where the liquidity preference curve is flat (that is / 0Ldr dG =  ) 
indirect monetary policy will have no impact on interest rate and real economy.

Quasi-Calibration Exercise
An exercise in calibration—in the context of this paper—would involve obtaining estimates for transaction 
costs and choosing values (or obtaining estimates) for the probability of default, bank concentration and elastic-
ity of demand (given the foreign interest rate) in order to replicate the flat bank liquidity preference curves given 
by the stylized facts. This interpretation of calibration is in keeping with the outline given by Cooley (1996).
However, for the purpose of this paper arbitrary values will not be chosen for the parameters of 
equation 7. Instead, excess liquidity of the respective country is plotted against the exogenous foreign inter-
est rate. If there is flattening of the liquidity preference curve—when non-remunerative excess liquidity is 
graphed against the foreign rate—then there is evidence to suggest that equation 7 is a valid representation 
of the behaviour of the loan market in the economies under study. Since values are not chosen for the model 
parameters, the term quasi-calibration is used rather than the conventional interpretation given by Cooley 
(1996) and by Hanson and Heckman (1996). The LOESS method is again utilized to fit the quasi-calibrated 
liquidity preference curves from non-linear scatter plots.
The other methodological issue concerns the relevant interest rate that must be used in the analysis. 
Two candidates are available: (i) the US three-month Treasury bill rate; and (ii) the three-month London Inter-
bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The US three-month Treasury bill rate could only replicate the flat liquidity pref-
erence curve for Guyana, The Bahamas and Barbados. However, the three-month LIBOR generates remarkably 
similar results of perfectly elastic (or nearly perfectly elastic) bank liquidity preference curves for each country.

The results are plausible since commercial banks in LDCs hold foreign assets in the form of deposits 
in foreign counterpart banks in an advanced economy. Hence, such investments are likely to be a lot more 
sensitive to the international money market rate (the LIBOR), which is used to price many money market 
instruments around the world. Only the results using the LIBOR are presented in this paper. The quasi-
calibrated results are found in figures 9 to 16.

Conclusion
The paper argued that the phenomenon of excess bank liquidity gives important insights as to the nature of 
the loan market in LDCs. Commercial banks require a minimum mark-up interest rate in the loan market 
before they lend to the marginal borrower. Such an interest rate stems from the oligopoly power banks 
possess in that market.
The paper also highlighted an important theoretical issue as it relates to the application of the theory 
of the banking firm to underdeveloped economies. It was noted that the banking model has to be modified 
to take into consideration the unique institutional characteristic of no exogenous domestic rate of interest 
that can serve as the benchmark rate as is the case in the advanced economies. Interest rates are determined 
by oligopolistic interactions. Consequently, a suitable foreign interest rate has to serve as the exogenous rate 
in any modelling exercise. Therefore, by introducing the foreign interest rate the paper pitches the banking 
model in an open economy context.
Two important policy implications result from the finding of the perfectly elastic liquidity prefer-
ence curves. The first being the very high loan rate that is likely to occur after the loan market is liberalized. 
This follows from the fact that private oligopoly banks are free to set the loan rate at any level they might 
desire. As argued earlier, banks will mark-up the loan rate to compensate for marginal transaction costs, risks 
and the rate of interest on the safe external security.
The second policy implication is the ineffectiveness of indirect monetary policy over the flat range 
of the liquidity preference curve. As highlighted by the stylized facts, the downward sloping portion of the 
curves occurs at very high loan rates. Therefore, reserve shocks (that is shifts in the reserve supply curve ow-
ing to open market operations) emanating from the central bank can only have desirable effects on the loan 
rate (and hence alter consumption and investment decisions) when that rate is very high. This is because over 
the flat range of the liquidity preference curve commercial banks set interest rates exogenously of liquidity 
shocks emanating from the central bank. The high loan rate, moreover, is detrimental to output and employ-
ment creation in economies where the banking sector account for most business external financing. Society 
and the policy makers, and the foreigners who advise the domestic policy makers, will have to decide wheth-
er indirect monetary policy is so important that it is worth the cost of persistent strangulation of domestic 
private investments in productive activities.
Two important issues that are the focus of future research projects have been omitted from this 
paper. The first one is the implications of persistent excess liquidity for money market development (and the 
operation of these markets) in LDCs. The second has to do with why banks operating in liberalized econo-
mies such as Guyana, Uganda and Jamaica, for instance, have been seemingly unwilling to invest all non-
remunerative excess reserves in a safe foreign asset? Hence, what does excess liquidity say about the operation 
of the foreign exchange market in liberalized LDCs?
What  does excess bank l iquid i ty  say  about  the  loan market  in  LDCs?          13
