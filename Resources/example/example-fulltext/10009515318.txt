Abstract  
The paper estimates the elasticity of Imports with respect to relative prices and income for 
Pakistan from 1971 to 2009. What distinguishes this paper from the earlier studies is the use of 
robust estimation technique of Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model utilizing the 
bounds test procedure. The results point to cointegration among the variables. The estimated long 
run elasticity of Imports with respect to relative prices and income are -0.53 and 1.22 
respectively.

I. Introduction 
In this age of globalization, substantial structural shifts in one economy influence the structure 
and policy decisions of other trading partners? economies. External sector has become a vital 
ingredient as the engine of growth for many a nations around the world. Ricardo?s comparative 
advantage theory has driven nations around the world for all the benefits they can muster from 
external trade, allowing them to grow at faster speeds than were seen before.  
Balance of Payments (BoP) account of a country shows the net balance of transaction of a nation 
with the rest of the world at the end of each financial year. Policy makers in a developing country 
like Pakistan are often comfortable with running external deficits in order to grow at faster rates. 
However, on the flipside running an unsustainable foreign deficit could render the country 
bankrupt. This thus leads us to the importance of looking in depth at the components of BoP 
account and changes it goes through over time. The most important component of BoP is the 
trade balance. In Pakistan, exports of goods constitute almost 11 percent of GDP while share of 
imports of goods in GDP is almost 17 percent.1  Thus the average trade deficit for last three 
decades hovers around the 6 percent mark. Over the stated period the share of exports2 in GDP 
has not increased much but the share of imports has grown from almost 15 percent in 1980s and 
90s, to 19 percent in 2000s. Thus given their contribution in GDP and relative increase in the last 
decade as compared to exports, aggregate value of imports has earned significant attention of 
policy makers for the external sector sustainability and timely exchange rate adjustments 
(whether discretionary or market induced).  
Given the significance of imports, this paper examines the extent to which the macroeconomic 
variables determine the demand for imports of Pakistan. The questions that need to be answered 
at the aggregate level are: how relative prices affect real imports? By how much do the imports 
increase with the increase in the real income of the masses? The answer to these questions lies 
with the econometric estimation of relevant elasticities. A lot of previous and recent literature has 
focused on the elasticity of import demand with respect to relative prices and income. What 
distinguishes this paper is the use of Autoregressive Distributed Lag model (ARDL) utilizing the 
bounds test analysis proposed by Pesaran et al. (2001) to re-estimate the import elasticities and 
the emphasis on economic implications of the results. This approach is intended to give consistent

and unbiased estimates, given that the sample period is too short to carry out the traditional Engel 
Granger (1987) or Johansen-Juselius (1990) procedures.      
The empirical results point to a cointegrating relationship between the variables i.e. imports 
demand, relative prices and income. One percent change in relative prices brings about a -0.53 
percentage change in demand for import other things remaining the same. Given that our 
estimated price elasticity falls in the range -0.5 and -1, exchange rate and import tariff policies 
can be utilized by the monetary authorities to correct the Balance of Trade disequilibrium. On the 
other hand a one percent change in income brings about a 1.22 percentage change in demand for 
imports other things remaining the same. This result holds significance for fiscal managers in 
terms of revenue collection and long term policy horizon, to gear the government machinery 
towards provision of basic infrastructure and market conditions for import substitution industries. 
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section II provides an elaborate discussion of the 
literature. Section III presents the data and the methodology used in the paper. Section IV 
presents the results of econometric estimation, diagnostics, interpretation and policy implications. 
Section V concludes. 
II. Literature Review  
The empirical literature on estimation of aggregate import demand function is vast. An earlier 
comprehensive literature review is available in Goldstein and Khan (1985). As times have 
changed, the estimation methodologies have changed too. Earlier studies were based on the single 
equation Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models. Granger and Newbold (1974) state that the 
standard OLS approach may lead to spurious regressions if the stationarity condition is not 
satisfied. Hence the resulting inferences would be unreliable. Thereafter came, the Engel-Granger 
(1987) approach and then a refinement in Johansen-Juselius (1990). In the presence of 
cointegration the Error Correction Method (ECM) has been widely used in the literature to 
estimate short run and long run elasticities.  
Some notable studies based on such techniques are Salas (1982) for Mexico, Gafar (1988) for 
Trinidad and Tobago, Gafar (1994) for three Caribbean nations, Arize and Walker (1992) for 
Japanese import demand function, Doroodian et al. (1994) for Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,  Mah 
(1994) for Japan, Mah (1993, 2000) for Korea, Bahmani-Oskooee and Rhee (1997) for Korea, 
Carone (1996) for United States, Bahmani-Oskooee (1998) for six LDCs, Sinha (1997) for five 
6 
 
Asian countries, Sinha (2001) for Thailand, Sinha (1996) for India, Abbott and Seddighi (1996) 
for United Kingdom, Arize et al.(2000) for Thailand, Milas (1998) for Greece, Dutta and Ahmed 
(1999) for Bangladesh, Raijal et al.(2000) for Nepal, Mohammad and Tang (2000) for Malaysia, 
Aydin et al (2004) for Turkey, Mwega (1993) for Kenya, Gumede (2000) for South Africa . 
A relatively recent approach of ARDL put forth by Pesaran et al. (2001) using the bounds test for 
cointegration has been utilized in many empirical studies for import demand: Tang and Nair 
(2002) for Malaysia, Bahamani and Kara (2003) for nine industrial countries, Constant and Yue 
(2010) for Cote D?Ivoire, Ho (2004) for Macau and Narayan and Narayan (2005) for Fiji. 
Ample amount of intellectual endeavor has also been put in for the same purpose in the case of 
Pakistan. Table 1 presents these efforts in tabular form. The estimates from Afzal (2004) seem 
pretty erratic compared to the rest of the studies. Also Sinha (1997) study shows negative 
relationship between import demand and income which is contrary to the theoretical literature. 
Excluding these two studies, the average import demand elasticity with respect to income and 
relative prices is 0.91 and -0.36 respectively.  
A recent study by Fida et al (2011) conducted the same exercise as in this paper. The long run 
elasticity of imports with respect to income was 0.613 while with respect to relative price it was -
0.042. The results point to no role of relative prices as the long run coefficient is too low to have a 
significant impact on imports and is contrary to other reviewed literature. Fida et al paper was 
focused on econometric issues, whereas the economic significance of the results had not been 
highlighted. This paper however focuses more on the policy implications of the econometric 
results. Also the purpose of this paper is to converge to a unifying estimate of long run elasticities 
in case of imports for policy making purposes.

III. Data and Methodology 
The formulation that has been used in most empirical studies for the estimation of the import 
demand function can be expressed by the following standard relationship: 
????????????? = ?  
????? ???????????
????? ?? ??? ?????????
, ??????  
Let us denote the above equation as: 
?? = ?  
??
??
,?          ?1 < 0, ?2 > 0 
That is, import demand is a function of relative prices (PT/PN) and income (Y). We expect a 
positive relationship between import demand and income while we expect a negative relationship 
between relative prices and imports. We have used the same formulation for their research. Many 
empirical studies have also included exchange rate as an independent variable (Afzal (2004), 
Alam and Qazi (2010)). We are of the view that including both the relative price variable and a

variable for exchange rate will create endogeniety problem5 in the estimation of the behavioral 
equation and thus have omitted the exchange rate from the equation.  
Khan and Ross (1977) and Salas (1982) have preferred the log linear model over the linear 
model. The log transformation is also advocated by Gujrati (1995) who states that compression of 
the scale minimizes the hetroskedasticity problem. Studies by Doroodian et al (1994), Sinha 
(1997) and Raijal et al (2000) have performed the Box and Cox (1964) procedure and have shown 
that the log linear transformation are more effective compared to linear transformation. For 
empirical estimation we log-linearize the above equation as 
ln?? = ?0 + ?1ln? ++?2ln
??
??
+ ?               (1) 
Denoting the log transformation in small letters, (1) can be written with time-series subscript as   
?? = ?0 + ?1??  +  ?2??  + ??                (2) 
The data set is obtained from International Monetary Fund-International Financial Statistics 
(IMF-IFS). For the purpose of study imports (mt) are defined as the volume of imports while 
relative prices (pt) are defined as the ratio of unit value of imports and Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) deflator, and (yt) defined as the volume of GDP. vt is the white noise error term.
6
 The data 
spans from 1971 to 2009. The rationale for using the annual series for the study period was the 
non availability of comprehensive quarterly or monthly data series on GDP deflator and GDP 
volume. The GDP figures are only available in annual frequency.  
  
                                                            
5 Including exchange rate variable, whose effect is captured directly through import prices and domestic 
price level would create endogeniety in the model. Senhadji (1997) and Tang and Nair (2002) in their 
studies used GDP deflator as measure of price of non-tradables. Given the changing basket of WPI over the 
years and the fact that WPI consisted of only 92 items at the time of the study, we prefer GDP deflator over 
WPI.    
6 We have also included a dummy D82 in our estimation. The rationale is the change of regime from fixed 
to flexible for the exchange rates. The dummy takes the value of 1 since 1982

In the presence of cointegration the Error Correction Method (ECM) has been widely used in the 
literature to estimate short run and long run elasticity. Inder (1992) presents a comparison of 
different approaches to estimate long run economic relationships and concludes that Unrestricted 
Error Correction Models (UECM) give precise estimates and valid t- tests even in the presence of 
endogenous variables. Mah(2000) argues that the two step Engle and Granger (1987), Johansen 
(1988) and the Johansen and Juselius (1990) methods of ECM are not reliable for small sample 
studies. Kramers et al. (1992) show that for small sample sizes no cointegration relationship can 
be established among variables that are integrated of order one.  
A relatively recent alternative approach to cointegration analysis has been put forth in a series of 
studies by Pesaran and Pesaran (1997), Pesaran and Smith (1998) Pesaran and Shin (1999), and 
Pesaran et al. (2001). This approach employs ARDL procedure using the bounds test for 
cointegration analysis. This approach has been advocated to correct for the small sample bias (see 
Pesaran and Shin, 1999). The bounds test procedure has the advantage that it can be applied 
irrespective of whether the variables are I(0) or I(1) (Pesaran and Pesaran, 1997). Another 
advantage is that the model captures the data generating process within the model (Laurenceson 
10 
 
and Chai, 2003). This approach presents the ease of estimating the reduced form equation through 
the OLS method. An restricted ECM can also be derived from within the model (Banerjee et al, 
1993) thereby incorporating the short run as well long run dynamics. The ARDL approach also 
overcomes problems arising out of non stationary data (Laurenceson and Chai, 2003). This paper 
uses UECM ARDL of Pesaran (2001) to calculate the long term income and price elasticities of 
imports for Pakistan. The paper also provides short term dynamics from the restricted ECM. 
For a total of 39 observations, we can quantify this as a small sample. We will first test for the 
unit root in respective series using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) (1979, 1981) tests. Given 
the variables are I(0) or I(1), we test for cointegration utilizing the Pesaran et al. (2001) bounds 
test methodology. If cointegration is present we estimate the long run coefficients from the 
UECM of ARDL. For short run dynamics we transform the equation into ECM. 
The above specification in (2) is transformed into ARDL specification as in Pesaran et al. (2001): 
??? = ?0 +  ?1?  ?  ???? +  ?2?  ?  ????  +  ?3?  ?  ????
?
?=0
?
?=0
?
?=0 + ?4  ???1 +
?5  ???1 + ?6  ???1 + ??                    (3) 
Where; ? shows the first differences of the variables. We then test for cointegration using the 
bounds test procedure. The bounds test is based on the Wald or F-Statistic and follows a non 
standard distribution (Pesaran, 2001). The null hypothesis is: no cointegrating relationship among 
the variables. The null hypothesis of no cointegration is tested by using ARDL UECM in (3) 
without the difference lagged variables. The null hypotheses is  
?0: ?4 = ?5 = ?6 = 0 
And the alternative is 
??: ?4 ?  ?5  ?  ?6  ? 0 
Given the level of significance, if the computed F-statistic falls above (below) the upper (lower) 
critical bound, then the null hypothesis of no cointegration is rejected (accepted). In case of the 
computed F-statistic falling in between the upper and lower bound no conclusive inference can be 
drawn about the cointegrating relationship among the variables.  
11 
 
From this ARDL UECM, the long run income and price elasticity of imports can be calculated by   
?(?4/?6) and ?(?5/?6) respectively (Bardsen, 1989). For the short run dynamics of the model we 
will have to turn to the restricted ECM. The error correction term ecm is defined as: 
???? = ?? ?  ?1?? ?  ?1??  
 Where ?1 = -(?4/?6) and ?2= -(?5/?6) are the OLS estimators obtained from (3). The ARDL 
restricted ECM model is defined as: 
? ?? = ?0 +  ?1?  ?  ???? +  ?2?  ?  ????  +  ?3?  ?  ????
?
?=0
?
?=0
?
?=0 + ??????1 + ??        (4) 
The coefficients of the lagged difference variables provide the short run dynamics of the model 
converging to the equilibrium path while we expect ? to be < 0 for it implies stability of the 
model. The coefficient of the ecm term signifies the speed of adjustment to equilibrium after a 
shock. 
IV. Results  
A graphical analysis of the three variables in the model is presented in Figure 1. All the three 
variables seem to grow over the time period and there seems a coherent relationship among the 
variables. The relationship between GDP and Imports seems more robust than that between 
relative prices and imports.

The inception point of any empirical estimation of a time series model starts with the test for 
stationarity of the variables in the model. We will utilize the ADF test for the presence of unit 
root in the data series. The results of the unit root test are presented in Table 2. Table 2 shows that 
all the variables are I(1). The preconditions are fulfilled for the bounds test to be applied. 
12 
 
Next we turn to the estimation of (3). Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Narayan (2004) suggested 2 as 
the maximum order of lags in the ARDL framework for the annual data series. Given the 
maximum lag length a parsimonious ARDL (p,q,r) model following General to Specific approach 
is selected on the basis of Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).  The total number of regressions 
to be estimated for ARDL is (p+1)k, where p is the maximum number of lag order to be used and 
k is the number of variables in the equation. Since p=2 and k=3, the total number of regressions to 
be estimated are 27.  The result of the bounds test for the cointegrating relationship between the 
variables is given in Table 3 for the equation that resulted in the lowest value according to both 
the AIC and the SIC.     
 
 
 
 
 
The selected ARDL (2, 2, 2) model with the diagnostics is given in the Appendix A. The long run 
behavioral equation from the UECM ARDL model is 
?? =  0.49 + 1.22?? ?  0.53??  
The derived coefficients from the ARDL model present the long run elasticity of imports with 
respect to income and relative prices. One percent increase in income leads to 1.22 percent 
increase in imports, while a similar increase in relative prices leads to 0.53 percent decrease in 
imports. This is also consistent with economic theory of the standard demand function as stated 
before. 
For the short run dynamics we turn to the ARDL restricted ECM approach. The result of the 
model along with its diagnostics is given in Appendix B. The behavioral equation thus derived 
from the model is as follows: 
??? = 0.31 + 1.57 ??? +  0.85 ???1 ?  0.13 ???1 ?  0.10 ????1 ?  0.42 ???(?1)

The coefficient of the error correction term is -0.42 is highly significant, which implies that the 
speed of adjustment back towards the equilibrium from any external shock that is outside the 
system presented in the study is quite brisk. About 42 percent of disequilibrium emanating from 
an external shock at t0  will get corrected in t1.

V. Policy Implications 
Heien (1968) argues that for devaluation to be effective, the elasticity of imports with respect to 
relative price should be in between -0.5 and -1.0. Since the estimated long run elasticity falls in 
this range, exchange rate and import tariff policies can be employed to correct the balance of 
trade disequilibrium in Pakistan. Change in nominal exchange rate will pass through on to import 
prices and eventually on to general inflation level. This would impact the relative price variable. 
Also any increase in the domestic inflation rate will trigger an increase in the volume of imports.  
Since imports are elastic with respect to the level of income, an increase in the income level will 
increase the volume of imports by the more than the increase in income. Government policies can 
be geared towards encouraging domestic industries that are not import intensive. Tax rebates and 
other allowances can be given to import substitution industries. Development of such industries 
will lessen the import bill and reduce the trade deficit as well as will raise employment and 
income level. 
Another implication of the elasticities for the fiscal authorities would be from the revenue 
collection side. Given the elasticity of imports with income is greater than one and imports being 
relatively price inelastic, revenue could be gained through duties and taxes on imports. Curtailing 
imports and reining in the current account deficit, based on macroeconomic fundamentals, to a 
sustainable level is paramount. Tariffs and taxes as allowed under the foreign treaties could be 
used in this regard to pursue policies of economic growth within the realm of sustainable external 
sector.    
VI. Conclusion 
The study was undertaken for the purpose of estimation of standard import demand function 
yielding elasticity of imports with respect to income and prices. Previous studies regarding the

not on one-off shocks (See footnote 6).

estimation were examined. The unit root test on the variables established the data series as 
integrated of order one (I(1)). Given the small data span, ARDL approach to cointegration testing 
was preferred over the other methods. The bounds cointegration test was utilized in this research 
effort and it pointed to cointegrating relationship among the variables. From the ARDL model 
stable long run estimates of elasticities were derived. The elasticity of imports was estimated to 
be 1.22 with respect to income and -0.53 with respect to relative prices. We then derived the 
ECM from the UECM. About 42 percent of the disequilibrium caused by an external shock to the 
system will be corrected over the course of a year implying speedy adjustment in the process. The 
outcome of the study holds policy implications for the monetary as well as the fiscal authorities. 
However robust our estimates be, future research on the issue should also accompany 
disaggregated analysis of the same. It would also be useful if the relatively inelastic petroleum 
imports are excluded from the aggregate analysis to look at the fundamentals drivers of our 
imports. Another improvement in this regard would be to utilize the relative price data of 
tradables versus the non tradables (instead of the commonly used practice of using proxies). 
Further still, domestic absorption variable might be more suitable instead of the GDP volume for 
it would present the income minus the external sector and would eliminate endogeniety that is 
inherent in the GDP and import variable. Further research could be geared towards panel 
estimation of elasticities of various countries for comparative analysis and also towards 
employing a combination of estimation methodologies.
