PROMOTING PERMANENT EMPLOYMENT: 
LESSONS FROM SPAIN 
 
 
 
Abstract 
 
 
 
This paper presents the first joint evaluation of the two major labour market reforms 
implemented in Spain to foster permanent employment in 1994 and 1997. The 1994 
reform restored the principle of causality in the application of temporary contracts and 
the 1997 reform introduced a new permanent contract with lower payroll taxes and 
dismissal costs than the ordinary one. To evaluate these non-targeted reforms I 
present a family of semiparametric estimators that predict the outcome that would have 
been observed in the absence of a reform by exploiting the time series variation of the 
outcome in the pre-reform period. Alternative counterfactuals are also explored by 
means of conventional between-groups estimators. Estimates using the Spanish 
Labour Force Survey indicate that employers did not change their contract conversion 
practices in response to either the 1994 or the 1997 reform. The 1997 reform succeed 
in increasing unemployment to permanent employment transition probabilities for most 
groups of unemployed workers, including the middle-aged. This result rejects the 
natural experiment research design in existing papers analyzing the effects of the 1997 
reform.

1 Introduction
Following the notable growth of unemployment rates until mid-1980s, France, Germany,
Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain increased the exibility of their labour
markets by allowing employers to recruit under non-causal xed-term (also called tem-
porary) contracts.1 Although regulations vary, a common feature of xed-term contracts
is that severance pay and dismissal protection are lower than those for indenite or per-
manent contracts. Since their introduction, xed-term contracts have accounted for most
new hirings in these countries (OECD, 1993).
Spain is a fascinating case to study. Soon after the reform liberalizing xed-term
contracts in 1984 the share of temporary employment was the highest within developed
countries. The 1984 reform led to a dual labour market with a third of employees em-
ployed on a temporary basis, receiving lower wages than otherwise equivalent permanent
employees (Bentolila and Dolado, 1994; De la Rica, 2004), facing a higher work acci-
dent risk (Guadalupe, 2003), and also a lower probability of receiving formal training
(Alba-Ramirez, 1994), of marrying and of entering into parenthood (De la Rica and Iza,
2005).2
The magnitude of the phenomenon placed xed-term contracts and its consequences
at the center of the political debate and motivated the application over the 1990s of coun-
tervailing reforms aimed at promoting permanent employment.3 The 1994 reform restored
the principle of causality in the application of temporary contracts (i.e. there needed to
be an objective cause to use them) and o¤ered scal incentives for their conversion into
permanent ones for certain groups of workers. The 1997 reform further lowered the cost
gap between temporary and permanent hiring by introducing a new permanent contract
with lower payroll taxes and dismissal costs than the ordinary one, whose regulation re-
mained unchanged. Any worker except for the unemployed aged 30 to 45 years old could
be hired under the new permanent contract.
The goal of this paper is to evaluate the success of the 1994 and 1997 reforms in
promoting transitions into permanent employment. By providing an assessment of the
1Other six European countries already had no limits on the use of temporary contracts. See OECD
(2004) for an overview of employment protection reforms.
2The literature evaluating the outcome of these reforms at the margin show that they increase both
job creation and job destruction and the variability of employment. However, the overall impact on
equilibrium unemployment is ambiguous. Alonso-Borrego et al. (2005) calibrate a general equilibrium
model with ring costs to Spanish data and nd that xed-term contracts increase unemployment, reduce
output, and raise productivity. Blanchard and Landier (2002) and Zhou (2006) nd that the introduc-
tion of non-causal xed-term contracts in France increased equilibrium unemployment. Finally, Kahn
(2007) evaluates the impact of employment protection reforms in several European countries and nds
no evidence that policies making it easier to create temporary jobs raise employment.
3In France, the applicability of xed-term contracts was reduced in 1990.
e¤ectiveness of these policies, this paper contributes to the debate on the consequences
of wage and dismissal cost reductions on employershiring and conversion practices.4
While little attention has been paid to the 1994 reform,5 the e¤ect of the 1997 re-
form on the proportion of temporary workers, transitions into permanent employment,
earnings and workersperception of job insecurity have been analyzed in Dolado et al.
(2002), Kugler et al. (2003), Plá and Ramos (2007) and Trevisan (2007), respectively. By
assuming that middle-aged workers were not eligible for the new permanent contract, they
nd that the 1997 reform reduced the incidence of temporary employment in the private
sector, improved eligible workerstransitions into permanent employment and earnings
and reduced their perception of job insecurity.
However, the identication strategy in these papers is not correct and, thus, their con-
clusions are misleading. Middle-aged unemployed workers could easily recover eligibility
by simple being hired under a temporary contract, since no age eligibility criteria was
stated for temporary workers. That is, the 1997 reform is a non-targeted reform (i.e. it
applies to all workers) and, thus, those papers do not identify the e¤ect of dismissal cost
reductions but the e¤ect of di¤erences in payroll tax reduction schemes across groups of
workers.
Furthermore, the post-reform period in those papers confounds the e¤ect, if any, of
the 1997 reform with that coming from the 1999 National Employment Plan (NEP). The
1999 NEP, passed on 30th December 1998, announced that payroll tax reductions would
last for one additional year for permanent contracts signed until May 1999 but they would
be signicantly lower in magnitude and length after that date.
The identication strategy in this paper allows me to identify the e¤ect of non-targeted
treatments like the 1994 and 1997 reforms and the 1999 NEP. I present a family of
semiparametric estimators that predict the outcome that would have been observed in
the absence of a non-targeted treatment by exploiting the time series variation of the
outcome in the pre-treatment period. Alternative counterfactuals are also explored by
means of between-groups estimators. Moreover, I separately identify the e¤ect of the
1997 reform from that of the 1999 NEP.
Estimates using the Spanish Labour Force Survey (LFS) indicate that employers did
not change their contract conversion practices in response to either the 1994 or the 1997
reform. The restrictions on the use of one type of temporary contract (the non-causal
4See OECD (1999) and Nickell and Layard (1999) for an overview of this debate.
5Güell and Petrongolo (2007) provide an exception. By estimating duration models for temporary
employment before and after the 1994 reform, they nd that the 1994 reform improved contract conver-
sions for women, the youth and the less-skilled. However, they do not control for cyclical e¤ects, which
seems relevant given that the 1994 reform coincides with the recovery of the Spanish economy after a
short but severe recession.

one) probably led to a greater use of other types but they did not encourage the use of
permanent contracts. Additionally, wage and dismissal cost reductions had no e¤ect on
contract conversions, which primarily respond to employersexibility needs and union
pressures for increased employment stability (Amuedo-Dorantes, 2001).
Regarding unemployed workers, while the 1994 reform had no impact on the hiring
of permanent workers, the 1997 reform increased transition into permanent employment
probabilities for most groups of unemployed workers, including the middle-aged. This
empirical evidence rejects the natural experiment research design in preceding papers
evaluating the 1997 reform.
Finally, estimates attest that employers reacted to the announced reduction in scal
incentives for permanent contracts by increasing permanent hires and contract conversions
in the rst half of 1999. This transitory e¤ect is found for most groups of workers, including
the middle-aged, and is, for unemployed workers, substantially larger than that coming
from the 1997 reform.
To summarize, estimates in this paper do not support the hypothesis that wage and, in
particular, dismissal costs are at the center of Spanish employersreliance on temporary
employment.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the content of the major
labour market reforms implemented in Spain in the last decades. Section 3 presents the
identication strategy. Section 4 describes the data used in the estimation. Section 5
presents and discusses the estimation results and, nally, Section 6 concludes.
2 The Institutional Framework
Until 1984 temporary contracts in Spain were restricted to seasonal, occasional or tem-
porary jobs and they accounted for less than 10 percent of all existing jobs. The 1984
reform allowed employers to recruit under temporary contracts for all types of jobs and
for a maximum length of three years. After that period the rm had to convert the
temporary worker to a permanent status or to dismiss him.
In the early 1990s the share of temporary employment was a third. The rapid increase
in the number of temporary contracts was the result of the cost gap between temporary
and permanent hiring. Mandatory severance payments for permanent workers were 20
dayswages per year of tenure (up to one years wages) if the dismissal was considered
fair, and 45 dayswages per year of tenure (up to 42 months of wages) if the worker
disagreed with the dismissal and it was declared unfair in court.6 In sharp contrast,
6Spanish labour courts tend to rule in favor of workers. Over 70 percent of terminations appealed to
courts between 1986 and 2003 were ruled in favor of workers (Galdon-Sanchez and Güell, 2000).
2
dismissed temporary workers received an indemnity of 12 dayswages per year worked,
which could not be appealed in labour courts. Moreover, the compensation was zero if the
employer waited until the end of the contract, which, moreover, tends to be very short.7
The rst reform designed to reduce the incidence of temporary employment was en-
acted in 1994. The 1994 reform restored the principle of causality in the application of
temporary contracts and introduced scal incentives for their conversion into permanent
ones for workers aged less than 25 and over 45 years old. Furthermore, in an attemp
to reduce dismissal costs for permanent contracts the procedural requirements for fair
dismissals were relaxed and notice periods were shortened.
Two years after this reform the share of temporary employment remained almost
unchanged. The perceived ine¢ cacy of the 1994 reform along with the fall of the socialist
Government in 1996 and its replacement by a conservative Government with a di¤erent
labour policy explain the new attemp to promote permanent employment.
The 1997 reform was the result of several months of tough negotiations between em-
ployersorganizations and the two major unions.8 The reform was enacted in May 1997
and it introduced a new permanent contract with relevant di¤erences with the existing
one, whose regulation remained unchanged. First, mandatory severance pay for unfair
dismissals was 33 dayswages per year of seniority (up to 24 months of wages) under
the new permanent contract. Second, payroll tax reductions ranging from 40 to 80 per-
cent and lasting for at least two years were introduced for permanent hires and contract
conversions under the new contract. Third, middle-aged unemployed workers were not
eligible for the new contract. However, this restriction was not binding in practice since
they could easily recover eligibility by simply being hired under a temporary contract.
Finally, on 30th December 1998 the Spanish government passed the National Employ-
ment Plan (NEP) for 1999. The 1999 NEP announced that payroll tax reductions would
last for one additional year for permanent contracts signed until May 1999 but they would
be signicantly lower in magnitude and length after that date. Table 1 summarizes scal
incentives for permanent contracts included in the 1994 and 1997 reforms and the 1999
NEP.
7Own calculations using the Spanish Labour Force Survey indicate that a fourth of temporary contracts
signed between 1987 and 2000 lasted for up to three months. The corresponding percentage for those
lasting up to one year is 70 percent.
8The agreement was totally unexpected. Spanish newspapers informed that negotiations were likely
to break down only one month before the agreement was announced (El Pais, March 3, 1997).

3 The identication strategy
In this section I adapt the estimators commonly used in the treatment e¤ects literature
for the evaluation of targeted treatments (i.e. those applied to certain employers and/or
workers) to the evaluation of non-targeted treatments (i.e. those applied to all employers
and workers). For simplicity, the identication strategy is presented for unemployed
workers and for the case in which there is only one treatment. The same reasoning works
for temporary workers and for the other treatments under evaluation.
Let Y (i; t) be the outcome of interest for individual i at time t. This variable equals
one if individual i moves from unemployment at the beginning of period t to a permanent
contract in that period and zero otherwise. Additionally, let X (i; t) be a vector including
information recorded at the beginning of period t relative to individual i that is a priori
thought to inuence his probability of obtaining a permanent contract. A non-targeted
policy aimed at promoting the hiring of permanent workers is enacted at the beginning of
period t = 1. Variable Di indicates whether individual i is observed in the pre-treatment
period (Di = 0; t < 1) or in the post-treatment period (Di = 1; t = 1).
Following Rubin (1974) and Heckman (1990) causality is dened in terms of potential
outcomes. Variable Y0 (i; t) is the outcome that individual i would attain at time t if he
had not been a¤ected by the treatment. Equivalently, variable Y1 (i; t) is the outcome
that individual i would experience at time t if he had received the treatment. Individual
causal e¤ects cannot be computed since just one of these potential outcomes is observed
for a given individual at a given period. Thus, the evaluation literature analyzes average
measures of the e¤ect of the treatment. I focus on the average gain of receiving treatment
for those who e¤ectively receive the treatment.9 This quantity is known as the average
treatment e¤ect on the treated (ATET) and is written as follows:
ATET = E [Y1 (i; t)  Y0 (i; t) jt = 1] = E [Y1 (i; t) jt = 1]  E [Y0 (i; t) jt = 1] (1)
The ATET cannot be identied using observational data since Y0 (i; t) is only observed
for those unemployed in the pre-treatment period. A suitable solution would be to ap-
proximate the proportion of treated unemployed workers that would have obtained a
permanent job in the absence of the treatment by the proportion observed in the last
pre-treatment period. The credibility of this approximation is higher once di¤erences in
the distribution of covariates are controled for. Under this approximation the ATET is
written as follows:10
ATET = E [Y (i; t) jX (i; t) ; t = 1]  E [Y (i; t) jX (i; t) ; t = 0] (2)
9The average e¤ect of the treatment for the treated is equivalent to that for an individual randomly
drawn from the population in the evaluation of non-targeted treatments.
10Existence of expectations is assumed throughout.
4
This is a before-after-type (BA) estimator and its power to identify the ATET relies
on temporal stability (Holland, 1986). In particular, two conditions must be met: (i)
unobserved individual characteristics and changing aggregate labour market conditions
do not a¤ect permanent hires or their overall average impact remains constant over time;
(ii) the e¤ect of events other than the treatment that happen between these two periods
do not contaminate the causal analysis. The assumption underlying this estimator is
formally written as follows:
ASSUMPTION 3.1: E [Y0 (i; t) jX (i; t) ; t = 1] = E [Y0 (i; t) jX (i; t) ; t = 0]
Following Meyer (1995), Assumption 3.1 is examined by sequentially estimating equation
(2) in the pre-treatment period.11 Under Assumption 3.1 the vector of pre-treatment
estimates is not signicantly di¤erent from zero and, thus, conditioning on observables
su¢ ces to identify the ATET.12 If Assumption 3.1 is rejected, the BA estimator does not
provide information on the outcome that would have been observed in the post-treatment
period in the absence of the treatment and, thus, it does not identify the ATET. In that
case I consider an alternative estimator and examine its identication assumption in the
pre-treatment period.
The next estimator that I consider is a di¤erence-in-di¤erences-type (DD) estimator
assuming that the average conditional (on X) outcome experiences a constant increment
over time in the absence of the treatment. Equivalently, in the evaluation of targeted
treatments the DD estimator identies the ATET under the assumption that the average
conditional outcome experiences the same increment over time for the treated and control
groups in the absence of the treatment.13 The identication assumption underlying the
DD estimator is the following:14
ASSUMPTION 3.2: E [Y0jX; t = 1] E [Y0jX; t = 0] = E [Y0jX; t = 0] E [Y0jX; t =  1]
Under Assumption 3.2 the ATET can be expressed as follows:
ATET = fE [Y jX; t = 1]  E [Y jX; t = 0] g
 fE [Y jX; t = 0]  E [Y jX; t =  1]g . (3)
11Meyer (1995) stated that an underemphasized advantadge of a long time-series for outcome measures
is that they may allow the researcher to examine the hypothesis underlying the implemented estimator.
12This approach is named selection on observables (Barnow, Cain, and Goldberger (1981)), ignorable
treatment assignment (Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983)) or conditional independence assumption (Lechner
(1999)).
13See Angrist and Krueger (1999) for an overview of the di¤erence-in-di¤erences estimator in the
evaluation of targeted treatments.
14Hereinafter the individual and time arguments i and t will dropped out to simplify the notation.
5
As before, Assumption 3.2 is tested by sequentially estimating equation (3) in the pre-
treatment period. If the vector of pre-treatment DD estimates is signicantly di¤erent
from zero I move to an estimator identifying the ATET under the assumption that the
average conditional outcome increases at a constant rate in the absence of the treatment.
This assumption is formally written as follows:
ASSUMPTION 3.3: Let 0 denote the increment in the average conditional outcome that
would have been observed in the absence of the treatment between periods t =    1 and
t =  , that is, 0 = E [Y0jX; t =  ]  E [Y0jX; t =    1], then
01  00 = 00  0 1
To compactly write the estimator that identies the ATET under Assumption 3.3, let 
represent the increment in the average conditional outcome between periods t =    1
and t =  , that is,  = E [Y jX; t =  ]  E [Y jX; t =    1], then
ATET = f1  0g   f0   1g (4)
This estimator is a di¤erence-in-di¤erence-in-di¤erences-type (DDD) estimator.15 The
DD and BA estimators are particular cases of the DDD estimator. If the average con-
ditional outcome follows a linear time trend or remains constant in the absence of the
treatment Assumption 3.3 simplies to Assumption 3.2 or Assumption 3.1, respectively.
More sophisticated estimators could be dened for the case in which Assumption 3.3 is
rejected. However, the discussion is limited to those implemented in the analysis.
Abadie (2005) develops a simple two-step method to estimate the e¤ect of a targeted
treatment on the treated using the DD estimator. That procedure is now adapted to
the case in which the DDD estimator is used to identify the e¤ect of a non-targeted
treatment. Assumption 3.4 is necessary for the evaluation problem to be well dened.
Since identication is attained after conditioning on covariates, it is required that for a
given value of the covariates there is some fraction of the population in the pre-treatment
period to be used as controls.
ASSUMPTION 3.4: P (D = 1) > 0 and with probability one P (D = 1jX) < 1.
Some additional notation is needed at this point. Let D 2 f0; 1g indicate whether the
unemployed worker is observed at period t =  (D = 1) and let  be:
 =
D
P (t =  jX)  
D 1
P (t =    1jX)

LEMMA 3.1. If Assumption 3.3 holds, and for values of X such that 0 < P (t = 1jX) < 1,
we have E [Y1 (1)  Y0 (1) jX; t = 1] = E [Y jX], where
 = (1  0)  (0   1)
A formal proof of Lemma 3.1 can be easily derived from Abadie (2005). The expres-
sion for  is obtained by replacing conditional expectations at t =  by terms like
(D=P (t =  jX)) in equation (4). Under Assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 the ATET is iden-
tied by:
E [Y1 (1)  Y0 (1) jt = 1] =

P (t = 1jX)
P (t =  1jX)  D 2
P (t = 1jX)
P (t =  2jX)
Equation (5) suggests a simple two-step method to estimate the ATET under Assumptions
3.3 and 3.4. First, conditional probabilites are estimated by means of a multinomial logit
model and tted values of P (t = 1jX) and P (t = kjX) are computed for the unemployed
at pre-treatment period t = k, for k = f0;  1;  2g.16 Second, tted values are plugged
into the sample analog of equation (5).17 Under Assumptions 3.3 and 3.4 a simple weighted
average of the outcome variable recovers the ATET. The weighting function ! imposes the
distribution of covariates for treated unemployed workers at any pre-treatment period.18
The expressions for  and ! in a general T -period estimator are the following:

#
16The conditional probability of receiving treatment given individual characteristics (P (t = 1=X)) is
known as the propensity score.
17Following Abadie (2005), I assume that  =  1 if P (t = 1jX) = 0. That choice is inconsequential
since the objects of interest will be integrals over the distribution of the X conditional on t = 1.
18See Abadie (2005) for a detailed description of the weighting scheme.
7
The expressions for the DDD, DD and BA estimators are those for T = 4, T = 3 and
T = 2, respectively. The asymptotic properties of the general T -period estimator are
presented in the Appendix.
Finally, the discrete nature of the dependent variable may imply that the assumptions
underlying the estimators do not hold for the expectations but for some transformation
thereof. Following Blundell et al. (2001), I assume that the assumptions hold, if anything,
for the inverse of the probability function, which I assume to be the inverse logistic.
4 The Data
The data is drawn from the rotating panel version of the Spanish Labour Force Survey
(LFS). This nationally representative survey is carried out on a quarterly basis on a sample
of approximately 64,000 households. Each household is interviewed for a maximum of six
consecutive quarters and every quarter one sixth of the sample is renewed. The avaliable
sample period ranges from the second quarter of 1987 to the fourth quarter of year 2000.
That is, it starts soon after the liberalization of temporary contracts and it covers the
1994 and 1997 counter-reforms and the 1999 NEP.
Employers, self-employed, agricultural and family workers, coop members and those
aged 65 and over are dropped from each quarter total sample. Sociodemographic informa-
tion such as gender, age, level of education, region of residence, marital status, whether
the individual is the head of his household or not and the number of employed household
members but him is included in the analysis. Equivalently, individual employment records
such as tenure at current job and sector of activity are also included. The same informa-
tion is considered for unemployed workers referred to their lastest job, if any. Similarly,
I also control for the length of their current unemployment spell, whether they receive
unemployment benets or not and whether they have previous work experience or not.
Information on tenure at current and previous job is based on self-reported elapsed
duration. The LFS records the answers in months whenever elapsed duration is lower
than one year and in years otherwise. Following Güell and Petrongolo (2007), I randomly
replace each rounded elapsed duration by one of the quarterly durations implied.
Tables 2 and 3 describe the data at hand for temporary and unemployed workers,
respectively. Transition probabilities are computed as the proportion of temporary and
unemployed workers at a given quarter that hold a permanent contract in the following
quarter. Transition into permanent employment probabilities are much lower after the
1994 reform than before. Regarding the 1997 reform, contract conversions decrease but
transitions into permanent employment for younger and middle-aged unemployed workers
increase once the 1997 reform is enacted.
8
A more detailed description of the data is provided in Figures 1 to 4. Figures 1 and
2 (Figures 3 and 4) plot transition into permanent employment probabilities for male
and female temporary (unemployed) workers, respectively. The information in these g-
ures can be summarized in four points. First, transition probabilities follow a loosely
monotonically decreasing time trend over the sample period. Second, transition proba-
bilities become stable by approximately 1994, that is, coinciding with the introduction of
the 1994 reform and the recovery of the Spanish economy. Third, no signicant change
in transition probabilities is observed once the 1997 reform is enacted. Finally, perma-
nent hires and contract conversions increase in the rst half of 1999, that is, before the
reduction in scal incentives for permanent contracts announced in the 1999 NEP.
Obviously, no causal conclusion regarding the e¢ cacy of these policies can be reached
at this point. Di¤erences in the distribution of covariates among employees at di¤erent
periods and/or changes in business cycle conditions might totally or partially explain
the observed pattern of transitions into permanent employment. In the next section I
implement the identication strategy outlined in the preceding section to properly isolate
the e¤ects of interest.
5 Empirical results
In the empirical analysis period t = 1 collects ows into permanent employment between
quarters  and  + 1, for  = f1997:3; 1997:4; 1998:1g and, thus, it captures the e¤ect,
if any, of the 1997 reform. Equivalently, period t = 2 is a three-quarter period ranging
from 1998:3 to 1999:1 that includes the period of higher scal incentives for permanent
contracts dened in the 1999 NEP. Remaining periods are dened to include the same
distribution of quarters as these two periods. I control for seasonal e¤ects by including the
quarter at which the worker is observed in X. Estimation results are separately discussed
for temporary and unemployed workers.
5.1 Temporary workers
Table 4 presents BA estimates for younger, middle-aged and older male and female tem-
porary workers. Under Assumption 3.1, the estimates obtained when comparing periods
t and t + 1, for t =  3, t = 0 and t = 1, identify the e¤ect on temporary to permanent
transition probabilities of the 1994 and 1997 reforms and the 1999 NEP, respectively.
Estimates indicate that Assumption 3.1 holds for older female temporary workers and
that none of the policies under evaluation succeed in increasing their probability of working
under a permanent contract. The same holds for older men regarding the 1997 reform
and the 1999 NEP, since Assumption 3.1 is not rejected from 1993 onwards and, thus, BA

estimates provide information on the e¤ect of these two policies. This is an interesting
result since, as shown in Table 1, scal incentives for the conversion of temporary contracts
into permanent ones were highest in the 1994 and 1997 reforms for workers aged over 45
years. The signicant estimates obtained in the pre-reform period indicate that the e¤ect
of the 1994 reform for older men cannot be analyzed using the BA estimator.
Regarding middle-aged workers, their probability of obtaining a permanent position
decreases until 1994, particularly so for men. Then, coinciding with the recovery of the
Spanish economy and the introduction of the 1994 reform there starts a period of stability
that is replaced in 1996 by a new decreasing trend that continues once the 1997 reform
is enacted. Finally, estimates indicate that transitions from temporary to permanent
employment were signicantly higher than expected in period t = 2.
The picture for younger workers is the same as for the middle-aged but in the period
following the introduction of the 1997 reform. In period t = 1 contract conversions
decrease for the middle-aged while they remain unchanged for younger workers. For
women, the di¤erential in the stability of temporary to permanent transition probabilities
between younger and middle-aged workers is observed from 1994.
These estimates are not informative about the e¤ect of the 1994 and 1997 reforms for
younger and middle-aged workers. First, the stability of contract conversions from 1994
onwards could totally or partially be due to the recovery of the Spanish economy after a
short but severe recession in which more than 800,000 employees were dismissed between
1991 and 1993.19 Second, Assumption 3.1 is rejected for younger men and middle-aged
workers in some estimates between the 1994 and 1997 reforms and, thus, the BA estimator
does not approximate the outcome that would have been observed for these workers in
period t = 1 in the absence of the 1997 reform. This assumption only holds from 1994
onwards for younger women and estimates show that their probability of working under
a permanent contract did not increase in response to the 1997 reform.
Conversely, estimates attest that employers reacted to the reduction in scal incen-
tives for permanent contracts announced in the 1999 NEP by increasing transitions from
temporary to permanent employment for younger and middle-aged workers in the rst
half of 1999. The implementation of the BA estimator over the sample period allows me
to examine if movements of a given magnitude are more or less common than standard
errors suggest (Meyer, 1995).20 The only positive and signicant estimate in Table 4 is
19Amuedo-Dorantes and Malo (2005) nd, using data on Spanish establishments, that net employment
growth expectations for the short-run are met with increases in net permanent job creation and hiring
rates, where net employment growth expectations are proxies of expected booms and crises.
20Blundell et al. (2001) proceed in a similar way when estimating the impact of a mandatory job search
assistance program. They implement the estimator in the pre-treatment period to analyze whether the
estimated e¤ect of the programme lies whithin typical values of the historical estimates.

that for period t = 2. Furthermore, estimates of a similar magnitude (in absolute value)
to that for period t = 2 are only found in the late 1980s and early 1990s, that is, at least
ve or six years before the 1999 NEP.
This result conrms that middle-aged temporary workers were not excluded by the
1997 reform and, thus, it rejects the natural experiment research design in preceding
papers evaluating that reform. The estimated e¤ect for younger women amounts to an
improvement of 32.7 percent in their probability of working under a permanent contract
in period t = 1. The magnitude of the e¤ect for the other groups of temporary workers
is derived from the estimator whose identication assumption holds in the pre-treatment
period.
In Table 5 I analyze if the DD estimator identies the e¤ects of interest for younger
and middle-aged workers and older men. Assumption 3.2 is not rejected for middle-
aged workers and estimates indicate that the 1994 and 1997 reforms failed at improving
their temporary to permanent transition probabilities. Additionally, estimates conrm
that their probability of working under a permanent contract was signicantly higher
than expected in period t = 2. Middle-aged males(females) probability of obtaining
a permanent contract improved by 43.2 (71.0) percent following the introduction of the
1999 NEP. The negative and signicant estimate obtained in period t = 3 amounts to an
equivalent reduction in their temporary to permanent transition probabilities and, thus,
it conrms the transitory nature of the latter improvement.
Regarding younger men, Assumption 3.2 cannot be rejected from t =  2 onwards and,
thus, these estimates provide information on the e¤ect of the 1997 reform and the 1999
NEP for these workers. Estimates indicate that the 1997 reform had no impact on their
contract conversion prospects and that their probability of obtaining a permanent contract
improved by 37.4 percent in the period including the rst half of 1999. Assumption 3.2 also
holds in the pre-1994 reform period for older men. Estimates show that this reform had
no e¤ect on their temp-to-permtransition probabilities. Conversely, this Assumption
is rejected for younger women in the pre-1994 reform period.
Next, I examine whether the DDD estimator identies the e¤ect of the 1994 reform
for younger workers. Estimates in Table 6 show that this estimator properly captures
the decreasing trend that dominates younger workerstemporary to permanent transition
probabilities in the pre-reform period and that the 1994 reform had no impact on that
probability.
To summarize, estimates indicate that the 1994 and 1997 reforms did not improve
contract conversions for any group of temporary workers. This result suggests that tem-
porary hiring was a deep-rooted practice among Spanish employers at the time of the
1994 reform and, thus, the restrictions to the use of one type of temporary contract (the
11
non-causal one) probably led to a greater use of other types but not to encourage the
use of permanent contracts. Regarding the 1997 reform, estimates suggest that employers
might be unwilling to forgo employment exibility through contract conversion regardless
of the employment cost.
Within-group estimators in the preceding tables indicate that a treatment is e¤ective
if the value of the outcome in the post-treatment period exceeds that expected given the
time trend it follows in the pre-treatment period. However, it might be the case that
an e¤ective treatment provokes no signicant di¤erence between the observed and the
expected values of the outcome in the post-treatment period. For example, it might be
argued that younger and older workersprobability of obtaining a permanent position
would have decreased in period t = 1 in the absence of the 1997 reform, as it did for
middle-aged workers.
To account for this alternative I implement a between-groups analysis where I compare,
for each period t, temporary to permanent transition probabilities for younger (older) and
middle-aged workers once di¤erences in the distribution of covariates are controlled for.
By implementing this estimator in the pre-treatment period I examine an alternative coun-
terfactual assuming that the average conditional outcome that would have been observed
for younger and older workers in the absence of a treatment is that for the middle-aged.
Estimates in Table 7 show that younger males temporary to permanent transition
probability is not signicantly di¤erent from that for middle-aged men until 1996.21 Then,
middle-aged malesprobability of obtaining a permanent contract becomes signicantly
lower than that for younger men and it remains at lower values once the 1997 reform is
enacted. That is, middle-aged men are not a valid control group for analyzing the e¤ect of
the 1997 reform for younger men using this estimator. Between-groups DD estimates, not
shown to save space, capture the di¤erence in the outcome variable that emerges between
these two groups prior to the 1997 reform and show no signicant di¤erence following the
introduction of the reform.22
Additionally, estimates show a signicant increase in the transition from temporary to
permanent employment for older relative to middle-aged men following the introduction
of the 1999 NEP. No signicant di¤erent is found in the preceding periods.
Regarding women, I nd that the probability of obtaining a permanent contract cannot
be rejected to be the same for younger and middle-aged workers except for the period fol-
lowing the introduction of the 1997 reform, when that probability was higher for younger
21Güell and Petrongolo (2007) also nd, using the Spanish LFS, that the age of a temporary worker
has a limited e¤ect on his probability of obtaining a permanent contract. In particular, they nd that
this probability increases from the category 16 to 24 years old to the category 24-34 years old and stays
constant afterwards.

women. This result suggests that younger femalesprobability of working under a per-
manent contract would have decreased in the absence of the 1997 reform, as it did for
middle-aged women. However, between-groups estimates for unemployed workers in the
following subsection suggest an alternative interpretation to this result.
Estimates in Table 7 indicate that the 1994 reform and the 1999 NEP had no e¤ect
on younger and older workerstemporary to permanent transition probabilities. However,
nding that a non-targeted treatment is not e¤ective using a between-groups estimator
has two alternative and untestable implications. On the one hand, it might be that the
treatment has no e¤ect for any of the two groups and, on the other hand, it might be that
it has similar e¤ects on both groups. Within-group estimates clarify the interpretation of
non-signicant estimates in Table 6 by showing that the 1994 reform failed at improving
contract conversions and that the reduction in scal incentives for permanent contracts
announced in the 1999 NEP provoked a transitory and sizeable increase in transitions
from temporary to permanent employment in the rst half of 1999.
Finally, Kugler et al. (2003) nd that the 1997 reform increased transitions from
temporary to permanent employment for younger relative to middle-aged workers during
the reform years. An equivalent result emerges from estimates in Table 7 if the post-
reform period includes periods t = f1; 2; 3g, as in Kugler et al. (2003). Furthermore,
they nd a negative e¤ect for older relative to middle-aged men, as I do in period t = 2.
That is, Kugler et al. (2003) only identify the e¤ect of di¤erences in payroll tax reduction
schemes across groups of workers.
5.2 Unemployed workers
As shown in Table 8, permanent hires decrease from the beginning of the sample period
until the mid-1990s and then become stable. That is, Assumption 3.1 cannot be rejected
from 1994 onwards and, thus, BA estimates provide information on the e¤ect of the 1997
reform and the 1999 NEP. According to these estimates, younger workersunemployment
to permanent employment transition probability improved as a result of these two policies,
with the e¤ect of the 1999 NEP being substantially larger than that of the 1997 reform. In
particular, younger males(females) probability of working under a permanent contract
increased by 22.9 (26.2) and 42.5 (62.0) percent following the introduction of the 1997
reform and the 1999 NEP, respectively. Equivalently, the estimated e¤ect of the 1997
reform for older men amounts to an improvement of 59.3 percent in their probability of
moving from unemployment to a permanent contract.
Interestingly, I nd that middle-aged unemployed workers also beneted from these
two policies. This result further rejects the identication strategy in preceding papers
13
analyzing the e¤ects of the 1997 reform. Middle-aged femalesprobability of obtaining a
permanent contract increased by 61.1 and 35.7 percent following the introduction of the
1997 reform and the 1999 NEP, respectively. Conversely, middle-aged men only beneted
from the 1999 NEP. Their probability of obtaining a permanent contract increased by
35.7 percent in period t = 2.
Moving to the analysis of the 1994 reform, Assumption 3.1 is not rejected for older
women and for middle-aged unemployed workers in the pre-reform period. Estimates for
these groups show no signicant e¤ect coming from the 1994 reform. Estimates in Table
9 conrm that Assumption 3.2 holds in the pre-reform period for the remaining groups
of unemployed workers and they allow me to conclude that the 1994 reform failed at
promoting permanent hires for any group of unemployed workers.
As for temporary workers, I explore alternative counterfactuals with between-groups
estimates in Table 10. I nd that unemployment to permanent employment transition
probabilities cannot be rejected to be the same for younger and middle-aged women but
in the period following the introduction of the 1997 reform, when that probability was
higher for middle-aged women.
Between-group estimates for temporary workers suggested that younger women ben-
eted from the 1997 reform since their probability of obtaining a permanent contract
did not decrease once the reform was enacted, as it did for middle-aged women. An al-
ternative interpretation to this result emerges if between-group estimates for temporary
and unemployed workers are jointly considered. This interpretation states that the 1997
reform had no impact on contract conversions but improved permanent hires for some
groups of unemployed workers, including middle-aged women. To be eligible for the new
permanent contract middle-aged women were hired under a temporary contract. These
temporary jobs were rapidly turned into permanent ones, explaining the negative (pos-
itive) between-group estimate obtained in the period following the introduction of the
1997 reform for middle-aged female temporary (unemployed) workers.
Evidence in Amuedo-Dorantes (2001) supports this interpretation. She examines the
determinants of Spanish employersreliance on temporary workers and nds that wage
and dismissal cost reductions for permanent contracts promote the hiring of permanent
workers but have almost no impact on contract conversions, which primarily respond to
employersexibility needs and unionspressures for increased employment stability.
The 1997 reform failed at reducing the proportion of temporary workers because it had
no e¤ect on contract conversions, which account for 85 percent of new permanent contracts
signed in Spain. Cebrian et al. (2005) indicate another reason why this proportion has
not decreased since the introduction of the 1997 reform. They analyze administrative
records on permanent contracts in Spain and nd that permanent hires under the new
14
contract increase the hazard rate of ending the contract by 15-30 percent relative to that of
ordinary permanent contracts. They conclude that Spanish employers took advantadge
of wage and dismissal cost reductions to substitute permanent contracts for otherwise
temporary ones.
Finally, if the post-1997 reform period includes periods t = f1; 2; 3g, estimates in
Table 10 suggest that the 1997 reform increased unemployment to permanent employment
transition probabilities for younger relative to middle-aged men, as in Kugler et al. (2003).
This result only captures the di¤erential e¤ect across groups of workers of the reduction in
scal incentives for permanent contracts announced in the 1999 NEP. That is, estimates
in Kugler et al. (2003) provide no information on the e¤ect of dismissal cost reductions
on transitions into permanent employment.
6 Conclusions
This paper presents the rst joint evaluation of the two major labour market reforms
implemented in Spain to promote permanent employment in 1994 and 1997. The 1994
reform restored the principle of causality in the application of temporary contracts and
o¤ered scal incentives for their conversion into permanent ones for certain groups of
workers. The 1997 reform further lowered the cost gap between temporary and permanent
hiring by introducing a new permanent contract with lower payroll taxes and dismissal
costs than the ordinary one, whose regulation remained unchanged. Any worker except
for the unemployed aged 30 to 45 years old could be hired under the new permanent
contract.
This is not the rst paper that evaluates the 1997 reform. Its e¤ect on the proportion
of temporary workers, net ows into permanent employment, earnings and workersper-
ception of job insecurity have been analyzed in Dolado et al. (2002), Kugler et al. (2003),
Plá and Ramos (2007) and Trevisan (2007), respectively. I argue that estimation results
in these papers are misleading since their identication strategy is not correct. They im-
plement a natural experiment research design by assuming that middle-aged workers were
not eligible for the new permament contract. However, middle-aged unemployed workers
could easily recover eligibility by simple being hired under a temporary contract, since
no age eligibility criteria was stated for temporary workers. That is, the 1997 reform is a
non-targeted treatment and, thus, preceding papers only identify the e¤ect of di¤erences
in payroll tax reductions schemes across groups of workers.
Furthermore, the post-reform period in those papers confounds the e¤ect, if any, of
the 1997 reform with that of the 1999 National Employment Plan (NEP). The 1999
NEP, passed on 30th December 1998, announced that scal incentives would last for one
15
additional year for permanent contracts signed until May 1999 but would be signicantly
lower in magnitude and length after that date.
The identication strategy in this paper allows me to identify the e¤ect of non-targeted
treatments like the 1994 and 1997 reforms and the 1999 NEP. I present a family of
semiparametric estimators that predict the outcome that would have been observed in
the absence of a non-targeted treatment by exploiting the time series variation of the
outcome in the pre-treatment period. Alternative counterfactuals are also explored by
means of between-groups estimators.
Estimates using the Spanish Labour Force Survey (LFS) do not support the hypothesis
that wage and, in particular, dismissal costs are at the center of Spanish employers
reliance on temporary employment. Employers did not change their contract conversion
practices in response to either the 1994 or the 1997 reform. The restrictions on the use of
one type of temporary contract (the non-causal one) probably led to a greater use of other
types rather than encouraging the use of permanent contracts. Additionally, wage and
dismissal cost reductions had no e¤ect on contract conversions, which primarily respond
to employersexibility needs and union pressures for increased employment stability
(Amuedo-Dorantes, 2001). Employers might be unwilling to forgo employment exibility
through contract conversion regardless of the employment cost.
Regarding unemployed workers, while the 1994 reform had no impact on permanent
hires, the 1997 reform succeeded in increasing transition into permanent employment
probabilities for most groups of unemployed workers, including the middle-aged. However,
the lower stability of the new permanent contracts as compared to the ordinary ones
suggests that employers substituted permanent contracts for otherwise temporary ones
(Cebrian et al., 2005).
Finally, estimates attest that employers reacted to the announced reduction in scal
incentives for permanent contracts by increasing permanent hires and contract conversions
in the rst half of 1999. This transitory e¤ect is found for most groups of workers, including
the middle-aged, and is, for unemployed workers, substantially larger than that coming
from the 1997 reform.

treatment on the treated using the DD estimator is now adapted to the evaluation of
