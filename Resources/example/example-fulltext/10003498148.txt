Adapt or withdraw? 
Evidence on technological changes 
and early retirement using matched 
worker-firm data 
Abstract: 
Older workers typically possess older vintages of skills than younger workers, and they may suffer 
more from technological change. Experienced workers may nevertheless have accumulated human 
capital making them suitable for adopting new technologies. On the other hand, to adjust to new 
technologies, workers must invest in training. This may not be worthwhile for the oldest workers, and 
technological change may thus induce early retirement. If technological change occurs often, 
workers will continuously invest in training, which may insulate them from the negative effect of 
technological change. We exploit the approach by Bartel and Sicherman (1993) to identify this effect 
by estimating the retirement response to technological change. We examine two hypotheses about 
the effects of technological changes on early retirement for workers from the age of 50 to the 
mandatory age of retirement at 67. First, we examine whether workers in firms with higher rates of 
anticipated technological change retire later than workers in firms with lower rates of technological 
change. Second, we examine if unanticipated technological change is positively correlated with 
earlier retirement. We use a matched employer-employee data set with a rich set of controls for 
worker, firm and local labour market characteristics, and firm level measures of anticipated and not-
anticipated technological change. We find a negative correlation between early retirement and 
anticipated technological change only for the oldest male workers (62 to 66). Further, we find a 
higher probability of transition to retirement for workers above 60 for firms introducing new process 
technologies.

1. Introduction 
The introduction of new technologies over the last decades, has certainly increased the productivity 
and welfare of the working population in the Western countries. The introduction of new technologies 
is also found to affect the structure of employment, and in particular technological change has been 
found to be biased against low-skilled workers (Machin and van Reenen, 1998; Krueger, 1993; 
Acemoglu, 1998; Author, Katz, and Krueger, 1998; Salvanes and F?rre, 2003). Thus, the burden of the 
costs of this productivity gain is found to be unequally distributed across groups of workers. The 
question we ask in this paper is whether new technology is biased against the work prospectives of 
older workers. This issue is all the more timely since in Europe the employment rate of older workers 
has been declining over time. For workers older than 55 it is below 50 percent, while it is above 50 
percent in the US. Most of this change is probably attributed to factors affecting labour supply, such as 
generous benefits (Gruber and Wise, 2004).1 The present paper focuses on whether changes on the 
demand side play a role in explaining the change in employment prospect of older workers by 
analyzing the effect on retirement of technological change.  
 The prediction from theory is not clear when it comes to the effect on demand for older 
workers. Older workers typically possess older vintages of skills than younger workers. This is 
because their investment in formal education typically is of an older date, and that they have 
accumulated human capital on the job over a longer period. Accordingly, their skill mix is of an older 
date, less suited to match new technologies. Hence, with respect to depreciation of human capital it is 
likely that older workers suffer more from technological change. Weinberg (2005) argues on the other 
hand that experienced workers nevertheless have accumulated human capital that makes them suitable 
for adopting new technologies. On the other hand, to adjust to new technology workers must invest in 
training to acquire technology-relevant skills. The investment decision will among other factors 
depend on the time left to planned or mandatory retirement. For older workers the investment in 
training may not be worthwhile if the time left to retirement gives a too short time horizon to make the 
investment profitable. The consequence may be withdrawal from work earlier than planned. Even if 
workers of all ages have similar ability to adapt to new technologies, the period to recover costs of 
investments in human capital may be too short for older workers.2

 It is of course not clear whether  supply or demand forces are the more important since most probably much of the changes 
in benefit schemes for early retirement has been implemented to accommodate changes taking place in firms' demand for 
workers. 
2
 There is some support for the fact that the ability to adopt computer use is not so dependent on age (or perhaps the net effect 
of the vintage human capital effect and experience effect), in that the relationship between computer use and age seems to be 
quite flat with a slightly more frequent use by the age groups 30-49 (Weinberg, 2005; Friedberg, 2003, Borghans and ter 
Weel, 2002). Weinberg (2005) also finds the age-computer use profile differs by education; experience to a certain extent 
substitutes for formal education.  
4 
 From this reasoning, one would expect that the probability of leaving the labour market is 
increasing with age when new technology is introduced to the firm, ceteris paribus. However, the 
timing of the retirement decision will also depend on the age of the accumulated human capital 
through on-the-job training. We exploit the approach suggested by Bartel and Sicherman (1993) to 
identify this effect by estimating the retirement response to technological change dependent on how 
often it occurs. The idea is as follows: Some firms are characterized by high rates of continuous 
technological changes. In such firms, workers have to update their human capital continuously. As a 
consequence, older workers who have chosen to stay in such firms probably have a less obsolete 
human capital than workers of the same age in other firms. They are more able to take advantage of 
the higher productivity, that follows from technological changes without a large new investment in 
human capital. We may therefore expect workers in such firms to retire later. This is a combined effect 
of technical change and selection of workers into such firms. In firms where technological changes are 
more extraordinary, the required investment in new skills following a technological change may be 
larger and more costly. All else equal, this will make retirement more attractive.  
 In our approach we analyze the effects of technological change on early retirement using 
firm-level data for expected and unexpected technological change. We use a very rich data set 
consisting of a rich matched worker-firm dataset with firm-level indicators of technological change in 
addition to other firm controls that are relevant for workers retirement decision both at the worker 
(wealth, indicator for health etc), firm (downsizing or not), and local labour market level (local 
unemployment rate, the degree of early retirement in the local labour market). Other papers within this 
literature mainly rely on indirect indicators of technological change such as total factor productivity 
(TFP) growth measured at a rather aggregate (two-digit) industry level. Firms, even within narrowly 
defined industries, may differ with respect to rates of technological changes, and using measures of 
technological changes at the firm level accounts for this possible heterogeneity (Haltiwanger, Lane 
and Spletzer, 2000; Doms, Dunne and Troske, 1997). We use investments in machinery and 
equipment over a period of time as an indicator of normal or expected technological change, while 
introduction of new process technology (conditional on investment level) is an indicator of 
extraordinary or unexpected technological change.  
 Our empirical analysis gives support to a hypothesis that technological changes in the 
firm where the worker is employed do affect retirement decisions of older workers. Older male 
workers in their sixties, with only very few years left before mandatory retirement age, in firms with 
higher ?normal? rates of technological changes retire later than workers in firms with lower rates of 
technological changes. For women we do not find any effect. In addition, we find that some of the 
oldest workers in firms changing process technology retire earlier than similar workers in firms with 
5 
no change in process technology. Hence, older workers in firms who experience an ?extraordinary? 
technological change retire earlier. Our results are in line with those obtained using more crude 
measures of technological change, and with less worker, firm, and labour market controls, such as 
Bartel and Sicherman (1993). 
 The next section will give a short review of some earlier studies on technological changes 
and early retirement. In section 3 we give a brief definition of technological changes, while section 4 
presents a description of some important facts about the early retirement options in Norway as well as 
the pattern of early retirement in Norway. Section 5 presents the empirical specification, and section 6 
describes the sample and some of the data in more depth. Section 7 presents the results, and section 8 
concludes. 
2. Literature on technological changes and retirement 
The literature on technological changes and older workers' retirement from the labour market is 
relatively small. There is a larger, parallel literature on the impact of technological change on wages of 
older workers and particularly the experience premium, which is strongly related (see for instance 
Weinberg, 2005; Borghans and ter Weel, 2002, 2006). The earliest study is Bartel and Sicherman 
(1993). Based on the theoretical human capital model in Ben-Porath (1967), they formulate two 
hypotheses on the relationship between general technological changes and early retirement. Their line 
of argument goes as follows: Some of the existing human capital is made obsolete by technological 
change. Training is required to reap the benefits of technological change. The effects on retirement 
behaviour depend on the individual costs and benefits associated with the technological change given 
an optimal response with respect to investment in training. 
 Their first hypothesis concerns expected or continuous technological change. Their 
prediction is that workers in firms or industries with high rates of technological change retire later than 
workers in firms or industries characterized by low rates of technological change, provided that firms 
with high rates of technological change offer more on-the-job training to take advantage of the new 
technology. More on-the-job training, given the level of technological change, implies a steeper wage 
profile and makes it more attractive to remain in work. However, technological change depreciates 
existing human capital. All else being equal, this reduces the return on investment in training. The net 
effect on training is ambiguous. Firms with higher rates of technological change attract workers who 
are able to benefit more from technological change. Among older workers, these will be people who 
have high returns on investment in training and/or people who plan to remain in longer in work. 
 Their second hypothesis relates to sudden or unexpected technological change. Workers 
respond to the continuous or normal rate of technological change by adjusting their levels of 
6 
continuous investment in training. A sudden technological change leads to an acute depreciation of 
human capital, implying a wage loss that can only be avoided through investment in human capital (or 
through a change in planned investment). For older workers, the returns to such investments are lower, 
because their remaining working lives are shorter. Sudden technological change therefore increases 
the retirement probability of older workers. 
 Bartel and Sicherman (1993) test their hypotheses by using data from the National 
Longitudinal Surveys of Older Men for the period 1966?1983. Their measure of technological change 
is based on the growth in TFP at the two-digit industry level. Continuous technological change is 
measured by using a 10-year mean of TFP growth. Unexpected technological change, or 'shocks', is 
measured by using a standardized annual deviation from the normal rate. They estimate a binary logit 
model of retirement, and control for a large number of retirement-relevant individual characteristics as 
well as technological change. The results support both hypotheses. Older workers in industries with 
high rates of technological change retire later than older workers in industries with low rates of 
technological change. In addition, unexpected increases in technological change are positively 
correlated with early retirement. 
 Ahituv and Zeira (2001) develop a theoretical overlapping generations model that 
incorporates technological change to illustrate the links between technological change and early 
retirement. The predictions of the model are consistent with the hypotheses stated above. That is, the 
closer a worker is to the planned retirement age, the less worthwhile is training because of the short 
time left in work to reap the benefits of the investment in training required to learn the new 
technology. This may in turn lead to an earlier withdrawal from the labour market. The authors also 
note that the productivity-enhancing effect of technological change on wages may generate incentives 
to stay in work longer. By using five-year TFP industry averages to measure technological change, 
and by using data from the Health and Retirement Study, they find that technological change has a 
negative effect on the labour supply of older workers. However, for those remaining in work, 
technological change has a positive effect on wages. 
 A similar analysis was undertaken by Friedberg (2003), who investigates the relationship 
between computer use and retirement. Using data from the Current Population Survey, she shows that 
those who use computers retire later than those who do not use computers. This may be because 
workers using computers have planned to retire later than nonusers, or because those planning to retire 
later choose to invest in computer knowledge. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study, she 
also finds indications that impending retirement does not generate incentives to learn to use computers 
because there is insufficient time before retirement to reap the benefits. This analysis differs from 
7 
those of Bartel and Sicherman (1993) and Ahituv and Zeira (2001) by analyzing the use of one type of 
equipment, namely computers, rather than investigating technological change in general. 
 From the review of these studies, we can draw some conclusions. There seems to be a 
relationship between technological change and early retirement. Workers in industries with high rates 
of technological change seem to retire later than do workers in industries with low rates of 
technological change. This may be because workers in industries with high rates of technological 
change have planned to work longer than workers in industries with low rates of technological change, 
and hence train more than workers planning to retire earlier. The studies also indicate that unexpected 
technological change is negatively correlated with labour force participation. Furthermore, Ahituv and 
Zeira (2001) find evidence of a negative aggregate effect of technological change on early retirement. 
3. How should we measure technological change? 
In the literature, several measures of technological change have been used. One commonly used 
measure is TFP. Ideally, TFP measures disembodied technological change, that is, increases in output 
that are unrelated to the use of more inputs or changes in the quality of inputs. TFP is measured as the 
residual of the difference between changes in output and the changes in an index of inputs between 
two periods. TFP may reflect the effects of all factors not captured by measured inputs, but empirical 
studies show that TFP is related to more direct measures of technological change, such as R&D 
intensity; see Lichtenberg and Siegel (1991), Geroski (1994), and Sterlachinni (1989). 
 Both Bartel and Sicherman (1993) and Ahituv and Zeira (2001) measure technological 
change by using TFP growth at a highly aggregated industry level. Hence, they assume that firms 
within these industries have the same rates of technological change. A consistent finding in many 
studies at the firm level is that there is much heterogeneity between firms, even within narrowly 
defined industries, in many respects. A priori, there is no reason to believe that this is not the case with 
respect to technological change. For Norwegian manufacturing, to which our data relate, M?en (1998) 
shows that there is a high degree of heterogeneity in firm-level TFP growth, even within narrowly 
defined industries. This indicates that industry-level TFP growth may not reflect the technological 
change experienced by individual workers and firms in the industry, which is the appropriate measure 
to use when studying how technological change affects retirement behavior. Since TFP growth is 
measured as a residual, it may be influenced by other factors than technological change. Hence, one 
should use indicators that measure changes in the technology facing workers that are available at the 
firm level. 
 One obvious candidate is R&D intensity in the firm. Technological change in a firm is 
often, but not necessarily, fundamentally linked to research activity. First, not all technological change 
8 
is related to the firm's own R&D activity. The technology faced by workers may change substantially 
even if there is no R&D in the firm because, for example, of the use of new equipment developed by 
others. Second, not all R&D activity in a firm implies changes in the technology facing workers. Much 
R&D is directed towards developing new products, which may or may not influence the production 
process. 
 Our measures of technological change (details are given in section 6) attempt to capture 
changes affecting the working environment in the firm. Technological change typically requires the 
acquisition of new machinery and equipment. To the extent that the technology facing workers is 
embodied in the equipment that workers use, investment in these capital goods may be an indicator of 
the rate of technological change. To measure the level of 'continuous' or expected technological 
change, we need an indicator of the normal level of acquisitions in the firm. The average investment 
rate or the median investment rate at the firm level over the period we are analyzing may be used to 
proxy the normal level of acquisitions of machinery and equipment, which captures the expected rate 
of technological change in the firm. We use the median investment rate to measure the normal level of 
technological change. 
 An additional measure of technological change is an indicator of whether the firm has 
implemented new process technologies. Information on this can be found in R&D surveys. Whereas 
investments in machinery and equipment may reflect the normal rate of technological change, changes 
in process technology may reflect extraordinary changes in technology, particularly when we 
condition on the investment rates in capital equipment, in the econometric analysis. Although changes 
in process technology may not be completely unexpected by workers in a firm, we assume that this 
variable is an appropriate measure of the implementation of new technology in the firm. Generally, the 
distinction between the operationalization of unexpected (extraordinary) and expected (normal) 
technological change is ambiguous. Although it is arguably the case that changes in process 
technology mainly reflect unexpected changes and that the normal investment rate broadly reflects 
expected changes, one should be cautious in interpreting the results as the estimated effects of 
different kinds of changes. 
4. Early retirement in Norway  
 The official retirement age in Norway is 67 years. At the age of 67, everyone has the right to 
withdraw from the labour market and receive an old age pension. Between 67 and 70, the old age 
pension is reduced according to labour income earned. For workers in some professions, such as the 
police and armed services, the retirement age is below 67 years. 
9 
 Many retire before the official retirement age, and there are several possible ways of 
leaving employment to retire. The largest early retirement scheme involves the disability pension. 
People who lose their ability to earn income may, after medical examination, receive a disability 
pension. More than 300,000 persons were on a disability pension in 2005, and the number has 
increased quite strongly over the past decade. The total number of employed persons was 2.3 millions 
in 2005, so the disability pension represents a common exit route from the labour force. 
 A special early retirement scheme, the AFP, was implemented in 1989. This was the 
result of negotiations between trade unions and employer organizations. The scheme allows 
employees in establishments covered by the scheme to retire before the official retirement age. In 
addition, there are individual requirements regarding previous employment and income. That is, one 
must: i) have an annual income of at least NOK 60,000 (USD 10,000) in 2005 prices in the year of 
retirement and in the preceding year; ii) have earned pension points (that is, have been working) in the 
national social insurance scheme for at least 10 years after the age of 50; and iii) have had an average 
income of at least NOK 120,000 (USD 20,000) in 2005 prices in one's 10 highest-earning years since 
1967. The retirement age under the AFP was originally 66 years. It has been reduced several times. 
Since 1998 it has been at 62 years. Ordinary old-age pension income from the age of 67 is not affected 
by being in the AFP. Because delaying or not having AFP income does not increase pensions received 
later, the scheme gives incentives to retire at the first opportunity. At the end of 2005, there were 
37,395 persons on an AFP pension. 
 The disability pension and the AFP represent the two main early retirement schemes. In 
addition, unemployment and rehabilitation may represent early retirement for older people. Although 
people in both groups intend to return to work, in practice few do so. In addition to these schemes, 
there are various private arrangements that allow employees to withdraw from work before the age of 
67. Given that there are many ways to move from work into 'official' early retirement and retirement 
schemes, a more comprehensive definition of early retirement is required for our empirical analysis. 
This is because our main purpose is to study how technological change affects older workers who exit 
from the labour market, rather than to analyze the effects of the exit routes from work into retirement. 
4.1 Patterns of retirement 
We consider the retirement patterns of older workers. In this context, 'older' is defined as between 50 
and 66 years of age. Figures 1 and 2 below cover the period 1994?2001. The sample consists of all 
persons in Norway who were aged 50?66 in this period and who were in work when first included in 
the sample, i.e. either in 1994 or when they reached age 50. Constructing the sample in this way 
implies that the observations cannot be interpreted as being equivalent to hazard-rate figures. This is 
10 
because, for those who are younger, sampled individuals are those who are in work when younger, 
whereas for those who are older, we condition on them being in work at an older age. For example, for 
a person aged 51, the rates are conditional on being in work at the age of 50, while for someone aged 
65, the rate is a weighted mean of the rates for those who were between 58 and 64 and in work in 
1994. However, cohort-specific hazards exhibit a similar pattern, and we prefer this more compact 
exposition. The figures reveal that disability pensions and AFP pensions dominate. There is a large 
increase in the share of individuals on AFP pensions from the age of 62 to the age of 66. The share of 
those having exited from work to disability pension increases almost linearly with age. Among 66-
year-old males, 16 percent of the sample is on a disability pension. For females, the share is 18 
percent. For the AFP pension, the corresponding shares are about 33 percent for men and nearly 27 
percent for women. As shown in Appendix C, the share of the eligible age group on AFP has increased 
over time, to some degree at the expense of the share on disability benefits. The share of 'younger olds' 
on a disability pension has increased over time. 
 The group 'other' consists of persons not belonging to any of the other five groups. These 
may be individuals who remain at home, individuals with private pensions, and persons in occupations 
with a lower retirement age than the official one. For men, just over 12 percent of those aged 66 are in 
this group, while more than 14 percent of women of the same age are in this group. Less than one 
percent were unemployed throughout the period. Few people of any age are on temporary disability 
pensions or undergoing rehabilitation. 
 Our study covers manufacturing. The corresponding figures for individuals (having been 
employed) in the manufacturing industry are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Similarly to the whole 
economy, disability pensions and AFP pensions dominate. For 66-year-old men, the share of those on 
an AFP pension is nearly 46 percent, which is higher than for the economy as a whole. Around fifteen 
percent have a disability pension, and this is similar to the share for the whole economy. For women, 
the share of 66-year-olds with an AFP pension is 34 percent; 16 percent get a disability pension. For 
both men and women, unemployment increases from the age of 60. The group 'other' has a lower share 
out-of-work women and men than for the whole economy. This may be because occupations with 
lower retirement ages are outside manufacturing. It may also be that, in manufacturing, a higher share 
of workers than in the rest of the economy has the option to retire with an AFP pension.  
 Details of the construction of our sample are given in Section 6. In Figures 5 and 6, we 
show the shares of those who are out of work for our sample, which covers total manufacturing. 
Comparing the manufacturing industry with our sample shows that the shares with disability and AFP 
pensions are higher in our sample. Otherwise, the patterns are similar to manufacturing as a whole. 
However, there are fewer in the group 'other' in the sample. Because our sample includes only joint-
11 
stock companies, most small firms are excluded from the sample. Larger firms are more likely to be 
affiliated to the AFP scheme. This may explain why the share in the group 'other' is lower in our 
sample than for the whole manufacturing sector. 
 The preceding discussion established that there are several possible ways into early 
retirement. The AFP and disability pension are in practice 'absorbing states', in the sense that few 
return to work from these states. In Appendix A, we show simple survival rates for individuals in 
unemployment, rehabilitation, and the group we have labeled 'other'. This last group comprises 
individuals who are out of work but are not in any of the other out-of-work states. When an individual 
over the age of 50 is in one of these states, the probability of leaving that state to work is quite low, 
although this depends on the state. Most individuals on rehabilitation either continue on rehabilitation 
or end up receiving a disability pension. For unemployed individuals, going back to work is more 
likely but this probability decreases with age. The same is the case for the group 'other'. Specifically, 
many women stay in the group 'other', many of whom are probably staying at home.  
5. Econometric specification 
Our econometric analysis focuses on individuals observed in work. We then estimate the probability 
of retiring conditional on having work in one or more of the three last years. Assume that we have the 
following model 
 
66 66 66*
52 51 51
,
1,..., , 1,..., and 1,...,
ijt it j it jt jt ijty Age MInvest Age Pinvest z u

?= + + + + +

? ? ?it it? Agedum ? ? ? ? x ?
  
where i is the individual index, j is the firm index t is the year index. Furthermore, *ijty  is a latent 
variable representing individual propensity to work. Agedumit is a vector of dummy variables; one 
dummy variable for each age between 52 and 66. All workers aged 50 are left out from the regression 
since they are all in work, and the dummy variable for the 51 years old is left out to avoid perfect 
multicollinearity. itx is a vector of individual-specific variables such as education, dummies for part-
time work, net wealth, whether the person is married, health and whether the person is covered by a 
particular type of early retirement scheme (AFP); and local labour market characteristics; proportion 
on early retirement in county, local unemployment rate, jtz  are the firm level variable we control for; 
downsizing. Year dummies, two-digit sector dummies as well as industry trends (interactions between 
year and industry dummies are included). ijtu is a stochastic error term.  
12 
 The variables of interest are two types of technical change interacted with the age of the 
worker (Age). Age is measured in a flexible way by including a dummy for each age; 0 for those 50 
years of age and a new dummy up to the age of 66. Technical change is measured by two different 
measures? permanent as measured by median machinery investment over years at the firm level 
(MInvest) ? and the unexpected technical change as measured by adoption of new processes (PInvest).  
 We do not observe the latent variable directly, but only whether the individual is working 
or retired. The dependent variable ijty takes on the value 0 if individual i in firm j is in work at time t, 
and 1 if individual i, from firm j, is retired at time t. Transition from work to retirement occurs when 
*
ijty 0> . If we let C comprise all the right-hand side variables in the equation above, and assume that 
the error terms have identical independent standard normal distributions, ( )| C 0,1ijtu ? we have the 
probit model 
 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )ijtP y 1| P 0 Pijt ijtu u= = + > = > ? =it it it itC C C C? ? ? ?  
where ? denotes the standard normal cumulative density function. So, ( )itC? ? is the probability of 
retiring in period t conditional on being in work in period t-1 and/or t-2 and/or t-3.   
6. Sample and variable construction 
The data used in this study are taken mainly from Norwegian administrative registers for firms and 
individuals. The use of consistent firm and personal identifiers across registers facilitates the linking of 
different data sets. Some registers contain both firm and personal identifiers, which enables the 
creation of linked employer?employee data sets. 
6.1 Sample of firms and firm-level variables 
 The manufacturing statistics are from an annual census covering all establishments in the 
manufacturing sector. The accounts statistics cover all nonfinancial joint-stock companies. The 
establishments covered in the manufacturing statistics are aggregated to the firm level and merged 
with the accounts statistics; see Raknerud et al. (2007). This capital database covers all manufacturing 
joint-stock companies. Data on investment in new capital goods are taken from the manufacturing 
statistics. The values of investments are in current prices. The stock of capital is taken from the 
accounts statistics. Originally, the stock values were given in historic-cost prices. We have converted 
these values into current prices by using price indices for investment in new capital goods. The R&D 
survey is biannual. We use the surveys from 1997, 1999, and 2001. We use a variable stating whether 
13 
the firm introduced new or significantly improved production processes during the previous three 
years, including the year of the survey. This is a binary variable, taking the value of unity if the firm 
has introduced new or improved production processes, and zero otherwise. When taken together, these 
data sets provide us with a sample of 4,717 firm-year observations, on 1,626 firms in 1997, 1,648 
firms in 1999 and 1,443 firms in 2001. 
 To measure the level of 'continuous' or expected technological change, we need a 
measure of the normal level of acquisitions in the firm. The average investment rate or the median 
investment rate of machinery and equipment at the firm level over the period under study can be used 
to proxy for the normal level of acquisitions of machinery and equipment, which represents the 
expected rate of technological change in the firm. We use the median investment rate to measure the 
normal level of technological change. We use information on investment in machinery and equipment, 
which comprises machines, tools, equipment, furniture, and cars and other transport vehicles. 
Throughout, we use the term 'machine capital' for all these capital goods. Investment rates are 
calculated by dividing the amount of investment in machine capital during the year by the net stock of 
machine capital at the beginning of the year. The investment rate is zero if there are no investments 
during a year; the rate is positive when investment exceeds zero. The median investment rate at the 
firm level is interacted with age to construct age-specific technology variables. We interact the median 
investment rate with worker age because the relationship between the rate of technological change and 
the probability of retirement is expected to vary with age, and this effect is expected to be larger at 
higher ages. Hence, we use a variable for the rate of technological change for each age. The variable 
takes the value of the product of the age and the median investment rate, and zero otherwise. 
 Data for process changes are taken from the R&D statistics in Statistics Norway 
(Statistics Norway, 2004). The R&D statistics come from two surveys: the innovation survey, which is 
available for 1997 and 2001; and the R&D survey, which is used for 1999. In all surveys, the 
following question (from the 2001 survey) was asked: "During the period 1999?2001, has your 
enterprise introduced any new or significantly improved production processes including methods of 
supplying services and ways of delivering products?"3 From this, we construct a binary variable that 
indicates whether the firm has taken into use new processes during the previous three years, including 
the year of the survey. We interact the variable with age to construct age-specific variables for new 
process technology in the same way as for the rates of technological change variables described above. 
 When firms downsize, which lowers the number of employees, workers of different ages 
may be affected differently, and some older workers may retire. Firms may also offer retirement

packages when implementing downsizing. Therefore, we include a dummy variable that is unity for 
firms that downsize, and zero otherwise. 
 In Table 1, we report descriptive statistics for the firms in our sample. In each year, a 
minority of firms implemented new technology. The average median investment rates are similar 
between years and between firms that implemented new process technology and those that did not. 
6.2 Individual and local labour market data 
We use individual-level data for the period 1994?2001. These data are taken from the FD?TRYGD 
database in Statistics Norway.4 This database has detailed information on employment relations and 
different pensions as well as information on education and incomes at the individual level. The FD?
TRYGD database is constructed from administrative registers covering the entire Norwegian 
population, but we limit our sample to workers between 50 and 66 years of age. We create biannual 
data files in which individual status is recorded at the end of the year. In this way, we create three 
cross-sectional data sets. Some firms and individuals are included in more than one of the cross-
sectional samples. The total number of observations is 140,920. The observations are distributed fairly 
evenly across the three years. In Appendix B, we describe the construction of the sample and present 
an overview of the observations by year. 
 In our econometric specification, we include age as a conditioning variable. This is 
because the data on retirement show that the proportion of retired persons increases with age. We 
construct a dummy variable for each age. Arguably, there is a positive correlation between bad health 
and early retirement, and in particular transitions to rehabilitation and disability pension. Sick leave is 
an indicator of bad health. We use data on sick leave beyond two weeks as an indicator of individual 
health. Controlling for educational levels is important. The propensity to retire early may differ greatly 
between individuals with different educational levels. Individuals with more education have invested 
more in their human capital and may have a greater incentive to work longer to reap the benefits of 
this investment. In addition, individuals with more education may have more interesting jobs. Thus, 
we expect individuals with more education to retire later. 
 There may be differences between workers who can retire with an AFP pension and 
workers who do not have this early retirement option. Workers in firms in the AFP scheme who fulfill 
the individual requirements for previous work experience and income described in Section 4.1 have 
the option to retire with an AFP pension. We include a dummy variable for each age between 62 to 66 
years to represent entitlement to the AFP pension. The variables are unity for those of a specific age 
who can retire with an AFP and zero otherwise. The local unemployment rate is a measure of the

15 
difficultly of finding work. Thus, we include the local unemployment rate as a control variable. 
Arguably, local unemployment is positively correlated with early retirement. We also include a 
dummy variable for part-time work. Those working part-time are arguably less attached to the labour 
market and thus may be more likely to withdraw early from the labour market. 
 Many factors influence individuals' retirement behavior. Apart from those already 
mentioned, norms may be formed regarding early retirement. That is, previous retirement behavior 
may influence current retirement behavior. If early retirement is common, this may make early 
retirement the norm. Hence, we include the share of retired people in the county as a variable 
representing the norm. See Rege et al. (2007) for an analysis of this phenomenon. 
 We also include variables for married people and measures of net wealth. The 
relationship between marriage status and early retirement depends on various factors, such as the 
retirement options available and spouses' labour market status. Thus, the effect of marriage on 
retirement is ambiguous. The same is the case for net wealth. On the one hand, individuals with high 
net wealth can become self-funded retirees. On the other hand, those with high net wealth may have 
more interesting jobs and, hence, want to retire later. Descriptive statistics for the independent 
variables are reported in Table 2. 
7. Empirical results 
In this section, we report our estimates of the model described in Section 5. The results from separate 
pooled probit regressions for women and men for the choice between work and retirement are shown 
in Table 3. In addition to the variables explicitly reported, we also included dummy variables at the 
five-digit NACE level interacted with year dummies, creating year-specific industry dummy variables. 
This was done to capture industry-specific differences ? and possibly trends ? in retirement rates. 
 The empirical results give some support to our hypothesized relationships between 
technological change and early retirement. From the preceding theoretical discussion, one would 
expect negative coefficients on the interaction terms between age and median investment rates, which 
measure the continuous or anticipated rate of technological change. Higher median investment rates 
should, all else being equal, be associated with later retirement. Further, the negative correlation is 
expected to be larger for the highest ages. For men, the sign is negative and significant for all ages 
from 62 and above. The regression for women has negative signs for ages of 63 and above, but the 
coefficient estimates are not significant. We expect positive coefficients for the interaction terms 
between the dummy variable for changes in process technology and age, which would indicate a 
positive correlation between the implementation of new process technology and the probability of 
early retirement for older workers. For men, the coefficients are positive for ages above 60 but only 
16 
significant for ages 64 and 66. The coefficients are positive for women from 62 and above, but only 
the coefficient for the 65-years-old variable is significant. 
 Let us consider further the magnitudes of the estimated effects from the probit model in 
Table 3. We calculate the change in probability of retirement (evaluated at sample means) for the two 
technological-change variables for ages 60 and above. We first calculate the difference, ceteris 
paribus, in retirement rates between individuals in firms with process changes and individuals in firms 
that do not implement process changes. Further, we estimate the difference in retirement rates 
following an increase in the median investment rate of 10 percentage points above the average median 
investment rate in the sample. The results are reported in Table 4. The effect of process changes is 
positive and significant for men aged 64 and 66; the estimated probability of workers retiring is about 
five percentage points higher in firms experiencing process changes. For 60-year-old men, the 
estimated effect is negative and significant. For the other ages, the effect is positive as expected but 
the coefficients are not significant. For women, the results are more mixed. Only the coefficient for 
women aged 65 years is positive and significant. The estimated effect is about four percentage points. 
The estimated effect of an increase in the median investment rate of 10 percentage points is a 
reduction of between one and two percentage points in the probability of retirement for men between 
62 and 66. For women, although the sign is negative for the three oldest cohorts, none of the estimated 
coefficients are significant. 
 Let us now turn to the other control variables, in Table 3. As expected, the coefficient 
estimates for the age dummies are positive and significant for both genders. To account for the AFP 
early retirement scheme, we have included dummy variables for those who can withdraw from work 
by collecting an AFP pension. These dummy variables have positive and significant effects. The 
variable for health, which is based on data for sick leaves with duration of two weeks or more, has a 
positive coefficient, as expected, although it is only statistically significant for men. Further, all else 
being equal, people with more education (than compulsory schooling) are less likely to retire early, as 
expected. 
 The local unemployment rate is assumed to be one of the measures used by physicians 
when evaluating whether an individual is entitled to a disability pension. The local unemployment rate 
indicates labour market conditions and thus reflects the possibilities of finding a new job for those who 
are unemployed or otherwise out of the labour market. The estimated coefficient on this variable is 
positive and significant, as expected. The higher the unemployment rate, the more difficult it is to find 
a job, and the higher is the probability of early retirement. Reductions in employment at the firm level 
may be followed by early retirement of some older workers. We obtain a positive coefficient for this 
variable. Another variable that reflects the behavior of people in the same geographical area, and 
17 
which may affect the probability of early retirement, is the share of retired people in the county. This 
variable enters significantly positive. The coefficient on part-time work indicates that part-time 
workers are more likely to retire early. The dummy variable for marriage is negative and significant 
for both women and men. The estimate of the coefficient for net wealth is not significant in either of 
the two regressions. 
 We now look at the results from regressions relating to the transition to disability and 
AFP pensions separately. From our sample, in the regressions relating to the transition to disability, we 
discard observations that involve transition from work to states other than a disability pension. For 
transition to the AFP, we only use observations for individuals who can withdraw from work with an 
AFP pension, and only the transition to an AFP pension is considered. The results from these 
regressions are shown in Table A.1 and Table A.2, respectively. Here, we report only the estimated 
effects of the technological-change variables for the highest ages. In Table 5, the results for transition 
to a disability pension are reported. Table 6 reports the results for transition to an AFP pension. 
 Table 5 shows that all the effects of process changes are positive for men. However, the 
effect is only significant for those who are 64 years old, cf Table 3. Men aged 64 in firms with process 
changes are 7.2 percentage points more likely to retire with a disability pension. For women, none of 
the effects are significant. The estimated effect of expected technological change is negative for the 
oldest cohorts for both men and women. The effects are only significant for three male age cohorts, 
those who are 63 to 65 years old, and vary between 1.3 and 3.4 percentage points. 
 The results in Table 6 show that process changes have a positive and significant effect on 
the probability of retiring with an AFP pension only for 66-year-old men and 65-year-old women. The 
estimated effect of expected technological change is negative and significant for men aged 64 and 66. 
The estimated effects are around one percentage point. For women, the effect is only significant for 
those aged 62 years old, for whom it is positive. 
 We also conducted a number of robustness checks. That is, we estimated the model 
separately for workers with different levels and types of schooling. We found that the results were 
similar across worker categories (results are not reported). 
8. Concluding remarks 
Technological changes affect the labour market in several ways. It changes the skill requirements of 
jobs and makes some of the existing human capital obsolete. In this paper we have analyzed the 
relationship between technological changes and early retirement behaviour of older workers. Older 
workers typically possess older vintages of skills than younger workers, and they may suffer more 
from technological changes. Experienced workers nevertheless have accumulated human capital 
18 
making them suitable for adopting new technologies. On the other hand, to adjust to new technology, 
workers must invest in training and this may not be worthwhile for the oldest workers. We exploit the 
approach by Bartel and Sicherman (1993) to identify this effect by estimating the retirement response 
to technological change dependent on how often it occurs. If technological change occurs often, 
workers continuously invest in on-the-job training, which may insulate them from the negative effect 
of technological change.  
 We examined two hypotheses about the effects of technological changes on early 
retirement measured for workers from the age of 50 to mandatory age of retirement at 67. First, we 
examine whether workers in firms with higher rates of anticipated technological change retire later 
than workers in firms with lower rates of technological change. Second, we examine if (unanticipated) 
technological change are positively correlated with earlier retirement. We use a matched employer-
employee data set with a rich set of controls for worker, firm and local labour market characteristics, 
and firm level measures of anticipated and not-anticipated technological change. Changes in 
production processes are assumed to capture unanticipated technological changes. In line with Bartel 
and Sicherman (1993) using industry level measures of technology and far less worker and firm 
controls than our study, we find a negative correlation between early retirement and technological 
change only for the oldest male workers (62 to 66) for those firms with high rates of anticipated 
technological change. Further, we find a higher probability of transition to retirement for workers 
above 60 for firms introducing new process technologies.

Appendix A 
Survival in the initial state and transition to other states 
There are several exit routes out of work. From some of the states, there may be transitions back into 
work. If an individual is unemployed, on rehabilitation, or out of work for other reasons, there is a 
possibility of transition back into work. Conditional on being unemployed, will the person continue to 
be unemployed in the following year and subsequent years, or will there be transition to other states, 
such as employment or a disability pension? The answer to this question can be used to determine 
whether the out-of-work state is temporary or a final destination out of the labour market. 
 In Figure A.1, the survival rates for unemployment and the rates of transition to 
employment and disability for men are shown. It is shown that 35 percent of men aged 51 that were 
unemployed at the age of 50 remain unemployed. About 30 percent are in work and the rest are mainly 
on disability pensions or in the group 'other'. The proportion of unemployed falls to 35 percent the first 
year, and then to about 20 percent after four years. It then remains under 20 percent for those aged up 
to 60. Thereafter, the proportion of unemployed people increases, and for those aged 66, 55 percent of 
those who were initially unemployed in our sample remain so. 
 The corresponding figures for women are shown in Figure A.2. For women, the picture is 
similar. There are only minor differences regarding the absolute shares. 
 Patterns for individuals starting in rehabilitation are illustrated in Figure A.3 for men and 
in Figure A.4 for women. There is initially a large decrease in the share still in rehabilitation the first 
two years. Thereafter, the share continues to decrease, but by less. Most of the individuals in 
rehabilitation subsequently receive a disability pension. For 66-year-olds starting in rehabilitation, 80 
percent have a disability pension. Few return to work. As in the case with unemployment, there are no 
significant differences between men and women, as can be seen from the two figures. 
  Few people are on temporary disability pensions, and they either continue to receive these 
pensions or subsequently get permanent disability pensions. Between 60 and 70 percent of individuals 
who start on a temporary disability pension end up receiving a permanent disability pension, whereas 
20 to 35 percent continue on a temporary disability pension. This picture is the same for men and 
women. Figures A.5 and A.6 show the shares surviving in the group 'other' and the transitions to 
employment and disability pension for men and women, respectively. There is some transition to 
work, and about 40 percent of 55-year-old men are in work. Thereafter, the share in work falls as the 
share in the group 'other' starts to rise again. Figure A.6 shows developments for women. It differs 
somewhat from what we saw for men when it comes to the transition from the group 'other' into work. 
Fewer women leave the 'other' state for work. No more than 25 percent are in work at the ages of 53 
32 
and 54. For ages beyond 54, the share in work decreases. Thus, fewer women starting in the group 
'other' leave this state. More women than men stay at home, which may in part explain these 
differences.

Appendix B 
Sample  
 We constructed three cross-sectional samples, one for each innovation and R&D survey. For each of 
these surveys, we sampled individuals employed in these firms at the end of the year before the survey 
began and for all subsequent years including the year of the survey. The survey covers the year of the 
survey and the two preceding years. The cross-section sample includes individuals employed in the 
firms covered by the survey during the three years prior to the survey year as well as those employed 
in the survey year. We then classified the individuals according to whether they remained employed or 
retired at the end of the survey year. The numbers of observations by year and in total are shown in 
Table A.3. 
 
34 
Appendix C 
Retirement rates for three age groups 1992-2001 
 In Figures A.7 and A.8, we show the developments in the shares of people on a disability pension and 
those on an AFP pension for the three age groups for the period 1992?2001. The share on a disability 
pension differs between age groups, and the oldest age groups have a higher share on a disability 
pension. The development for each age group is quite stable over the period. For men, there seems to 
be a small reduction towards the end of the observation period for the two oldest age groups, while in 
the age group 50?55, the share on a disability pension is about the same as in 1992 and 2001. For 
women, the share on a disability pension increases from 1992 to 2001, and increases for the oldest age 
cohorts. For the other cohorts, the share on a disability pension in 2001 is about the same as that in 
1992, but the shares decrease somewhat after 1992 and then increase again up to 2001. 
 The share of people with an AFP pension increases in all the years for both women and 
men. The shares increase particularly in years in which the age limit was reduced, namely in 1997, 
when the age for entitlement to an AFP pension was reduced from 64 to 63 years, and in 1998, when 
the reduction was from 63 to 62 years.
